Babylon greed for wealth\nDo you deceive yourself and let your ego swell?\nAnd disregard those who most need your help\nThick skin, the dark won't take my soul\nSurvive spiritual wars, see my welts\nAnd the evil's felt, but the faith is stronger\nI saw grown men fall when I was a youngster\nBut I clench my fists, ready to go against whoever\nTie my Timbs and rise in the end\n[Chorus: Damian Marley (Nas)]\nWhen the armageddon's dark and dread\n(I get up and make it happen)\nA lot of weak hearted weep and moan\n(I get up and we get it cracking)\nOnly the strong will continue\nDo you have it in you?\nCome, we've got a journey to go\nAnd when the battle get sour and tread\n(I get up and I get it going)\nA lot of weak hearted wither and moan\n(We get up and we keep it flowing)\nOnly the strong will continue (yeah)\nI know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)\nI know you have it in you\n[Verse 3: Damian Marley]\nNo man live forever, but never say never\nEvery good he want better, must be a go getter\nAnd always be clever in every endeavor\nCause drastic time call for drastic measure\nYuh birthright to pleasure From yuh navel string sever\nThe land and the treasure, work for whatever\nJah said don't be a beggar, the Alpha Omega\nWill bless every soul no matter which name you prefer\nThe immortal stepper, believe in every skin no matter which color they are\nWe never let we don't know here which kind of weather\nYou're destined to rise like the Son of Rebecca\nDon't stop for a second\nEveryone reckon, it sure would be good to be there\nWhether Zion or Mecca\nWhen the gates are finally closed\nAnd the saints go marching in\n\n[Chorus: Damian Marley & (Nas)]\nWhen the armageddon's dark and dread\nA lot of weak hearted weep and moan\nOnly the strong will continue\nDo you have it in you?\nCome, we've got a journey to go\nAnd when the battle get sour and dread\nA lot of weak hearted wither and  moan\nOnly the strong will continue\nI know you have it in you\nI know you have it in you\n\n\n[Verse 4: Nas]\nI'm a street lifer\nAlways harrassed by the cee cyphers\nChief like Geronimo with his peace pipe\nI emerged from the street life\nThis for the homies who relate\nKnow what it be like\nMy QB life takin' a turn to the Louis XIII life\nTwisted and mangled sort of like Bruce Lee life\nCursed with his son Brandon\nIf that's you and me, Knight, I pray our fates greater\nI speak life I still matter as a rapper, not doubtin'\nEven Toni Braxton signed a deal with Craig Kallman\nHow in, the hell am I supposed stay comfy\nWhen I pay child support, alimony monthly?\nGot Maseratis and Ferraris\nOnly like a woman who's a rider, But only ho's want me\nSingle life crazy, niggas wives on me\nI say stay faithful, they say their man corny\nSo I'm, stuck with a married woman\nSo fine, cheatin while they husband\nRushing on the 40-yard line, wonder if\nThis is what my ex did the whole time\nGood niggas seem to always end up\nWith some hard times, hope not\nIf a pimp slippin and a ho plot\nAin't nothin to a G in a two-tone drop, kid\nAnd it don't stop, See a nigga dissapearin\nWith the baddest honeys in the whole spot, yeah13Embed"

    "lyrics": "Patience (Sabali) Lyrics[Intro: Nas]\nHere we are\nHere we are\nYeah\nThis one right here is for the people\n\n[Chorus]\nSabali, sabali, sabali yonkote\nSabali, sabali, sabali kiye\nNi k\u00eara m\u00f4g\u00f4\nSabali, sabali, sabali yonkote\nSabali, sabali, sabali kiye\nNi k\u00eara m\u00f4g\u00f4\n[Interlude: Nas]\nHey yo D\nLet's go all the way in on this one\n\n[Verse 1: Damian Marley]\nSome of the smartest dummies\nCan't read the language of Egyptian mummies\nAn' a fly go a moon\nAnd can't find food for the starving tummies\nPay no mind to the youths\nCause it's not like the future depends on it\nBut save the animals in the zoo\nCause the chimpanzee dem a make big money\nThis is how the media pillages\nOn the TV the picture is\nSavages in villages\nAnd the scientist still can't explain the pyramids, huh\nEvangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids\nStereotyping the image of the images\nAnd this is what the image is\nYou buy a khaki pants\nAnd all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones\nAn' a thief out the gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones\nSome of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known\nPut the worst on display so the world can see\nAnd that's all they will ever show\nSo the ones in the West\nWill never move East\nAnd feel like they could be at home\nDem get tricked by the beast\nBut a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?\nSolomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone\nMy spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord\n[Chorus]\nSabali, sabali, sabali yonkote\nSabali, sabali, sabali kiye\nNi k\u00eara m\u00f4g\u00f4\nSabali, sabali, sabali yonkote\nSabali, sabali, sabali kiye\nNi k\u00eara m\u00f4g\u00f4\n\n[Interlude: Nas]\nYeah, Sabali. Thats patience. That's what the old folks told me\nDiscovering the World before this World. A World buried in time\nUncover with rhymes. It gets no realer\n\n[Verse 2: Damian Marley]\nHuh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?\nWe growing wiser, are we just growing tall?\nCan you read thoughts? can you read palms?\nHuh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?\nThe Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off\nNow the Earth is round\nIf the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh\nThe average man can't prove of most of the things\nThat he chooses to speak of\nAnd still won't research and find out\nThe root of the truth that you seek of\nScholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning\nTell them find a cure when we sneeze\nAnd that's when their nose start running\nAnd the rich get stitched up, when we get cut\nMan a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wet mud\nCan you read signs? can you read stars?\nCan you make peace? can you fight war?\nCan you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh\nCan you survive? Against all odds, now?\n[Chorus]\nSabali, sabali, sabali yonkote\nSabali, sabali, sabali kiye\nNi k\u00eara m\u00f4g\u00f4\nSabali, sabali, sabali yonkote\nSabali, sabali, sabali kiye\nNi k\u00eara m\u00f4g\u00f4\n\n[Interlude: Nas]\nIt's crazy when you feed people the truth you don't know how they're gonna react\nYou're scared of wrong doers, people that just ignorant\nYou're scared of the truth, be patient for now\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nWho wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?\nAnd was it a lightning storm\nThat gave birth to the Earth\nAnd then dinosaurs were born? damn\nWho made up words? Who made up numbers?\nAnd what kind of spell is mankind under?\nEverything on the planet we preserve and can it\nMicrowaved it and try it\nNo matter what we'll survive it\nWhat's hue? What's man? What's human?\nAnything along the land we consuming\nEatin', deletin', ruin\nTrying to get paper\nGotta have land, gotta have acres\nSo I can sit back like Jack Nicholson\nWatch niggas play the game like the Lakers\nIn a world full of 52 fakers\nGypsies, seances, mystical prayers\nYou superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders\nMake a wish for the day cuz\nLike somebody got a doll of me\nStickin' needles in my arteries\nBut I can't feel it\nSometimes it's like 'part of me, but I got a real big spirit'\nI'm fearless, I'm fearless\nDon't you try and grab hold of my soul\nIt's like a military soldier since seven years old\nI held real dead bodies in my arms\nFelt their body turn cold, oh\nWhy we born in the first place\nIf this is how we gotta go?\nDamn\n\n[Outro: Nas]\nThis goes to all the wisdom and knowledge seekers of the World\nSabali, Patience, yeah94Embed"

We 'bout to make a change)\nThis generation will make a change\n(Yeah)\n\n[Verse 1: Damian Marley]\nBoom\nNow me love fi see the schoolers them a graduate\nA-study hard, and save the party for the holidays\nDiplomatic with them diploma and them bound fi great\nBecause them nah pick up no 'matic and a-perpetrate\nAnd then I love the energies, what them a-generate\nMy generation, it so special, it will make a change\nBecause the elders sow the seed and it a-germinate\nSo anytime them see the progress, them a-celebrate\nBecause we rising up despite of the economy\nAnd then a-we a-star the show like the astronomy\nAnd how we keep on breaking through is an anomaly\nBecause we keep remaining true without apology\nThe mission have fi carry through and finish properly\nSay Gambia to Guadeloupe, Paris to Napoli\nSay Zambia to Honolulu, back to Tripoli\nAnd everybody want a future living happily\n[Chorus: Joss Stone]\nMy generation will make a change\n(We'll make a change, we'll make a change, yeah)\nThis generation will make a change\n(This generation, yeah)\nMy generation will make a change\n(We'll make a change, we'll make a change, we'll make a change, I swear we will)\nThis generation will make a change\n(I swear it now, yeah, hey!)\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nCan you blame my generation? Subjected gentrification\nDepicting their frustrations over ill instrumentation\n'Cause music is the way to convey to you what I'm facing\nPlacing my life in front of your eyes for your observation\nNow if you can't relate then maybe you are too complacent\nAthletes today are scared to make Muhammad Ali statements\nWhat's up with tomorrow? Will you lead? Will you follow?\nImprove your values, education is real power\nI reach 'em like Bono, so get rid of your self sorrow\nAdd some bravado, get wealthy like Wells Fargo\nIt's truth that I am you and I am proof\nSurviving through, we do what we gotta do\nYo, we could break the cycle, let nobody lie to you\nThen maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school\n'Cause there's a mission, we gotta finish before we leave\nThis generation is destined to do historic deeds\n[Chorus: Joss Stone]\nMy generation will make a change\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh)\nThis generation will make a change\n(My generation, this generation, yeah)\nMy generation will make a change\n(We'll make a change, we'll make a change, we'll make a change, yeah)\nThis generation will make a change\n(This generation now, hey!)\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]\nIf you weather that storm, then that rain bring sun\nBeen a long time coming, I know change gone come (We're makin' a change)\nMan, I gotta keep it moving to the beat of my drum\nLast night I set the future at the feet of my son\nBut they thinking that my generation gotta die young\nIf we all come together then they can't divide one\nDon't worry 'bout it, just be about it\nGot a message from God: \"Heaven too crowded\"\nBut I say, \"Hey, young world, you never looked better\nAnd I heard change start with the man in the mirror,\" uh\nThis generation, I'mma represent\nA generation led by a black president\nNow how's that for change? Who knew that can change?\nI don\u2019t even look at the flag the same, heck\nUh, so when you finish reading Revelations\nThank God for my generation\n[Chorus: Joss Stone]\nMy generation will make a change, yes\nThis generation will make a change, yeah\nMy generation will make a change for good, for better\nThis generation will make a change, yeah9Embed"

The slums, diseases, AIDS\nWe need that all to fade, we cannot be afraid\nSo who are we today?\nWe are the morning after, the makeshift youth\nThe slave ship captured, our diaspora is the final chapter\nThe ancestral lineage built pyramids\nAmerica's first immigrants\nThe kings, sons and daughters from Nile waters\nThe first architect, the first philosophers\nAstronomers, the first prophets and the doctors were us, us\n\n[Bridge: Damian Marley]\nNow can we all pray? Each in his own way\nTeaching and learning, we can work it out\nWe'll have a warm bed, we'll have some warm bread\nShelter from the storm dread and we can work it out\nMother nature feeds all in famine and drought\nTell those selfish in ways, not to share us out\nWhat's a tree without root? Lion without tooth?\nA lie without truth? You hear me out!\n[Hook: Damian Marley]\nAfrica must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob\nFor what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come\nYesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones\nWho are we today? yeah, Lord\nAfrica must wake up the sleeping sons of Jacob\nWhat tomorrow may bring. may some more love come\nYesterday we were kings, I tell ya young bloods\nThe world is yours today...\n\n[Bridge: K'naan]\nDadyahow daali waayey, nabada diideen\nOo ninkii doortay dinta, waadinka dillee\nOo dal markii ladhiso, waadinka dunshee\nOo daacad ninkii damcay, waadinka dooxee\nDadyahow daali waayey, nabada diideen\nOo ninkii doortay dinta, waadinka dillee\nOo dal markii ladhiso, waadinka dunshee\nOo daacad ninkii damcay, waadinka dooxee\n\n[Guitar/Instrumental Break]\n\n[Break: Nas]\nWe want to thank y'all, everybody out there\nThis is Nas, Damian Marley\nDistant Relatives\nWe're all distant relatives\nNo matter where you from, where you live\nHow near or far\nAfrica, China, Japan, Afghanistan, Israel\nWe're all fam, we're all distant relatives\nSo that's why we came together\nOne of the reasons why myself and Damian came together\n'Cause we all come from one place, and that's Africa\nThat's right, you too\nAnd you\nThe whole world!\nWe're all family, we're just spread out all over the place\nSo to all my distant relatives, let's take it back home!\n[Hook: Damian Marley]\nI say!
