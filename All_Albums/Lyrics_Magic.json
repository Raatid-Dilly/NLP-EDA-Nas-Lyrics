Yeah, yeah\nJust tryna get my weight up\nTryna get all my watches in order\nGet my safe up, get great\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm twenty-one years past the 27 Club\nIt's like I went back into my past and then I sped it up\nRobert Johnson, Winehouse and Morrison found where Heaven was\nHeaven on Earth, this shit is magic with no fairy dust\nHome of the gully, gangsta, the gruesom\u0435 and the scary stuff\nI told my brother Jung', \"Fuck 'em, th\u0435y gon' go through Hell with us\nThey don't have the history in the streets that compare with us\"\nHood niggas, they wanna be us, thugs in the St. Regis\nOnly thing undefeated is time\nThe second is the internet, number three is this rhyme\nBefore security, my dawg had to sneak in the nine\nGod must be on my side\nI had to eat and provide, my winning streak is divine\nI told dunn, \"Leave the street shit behind\nDon't let 'em hype you, a slow run beats cheatin' the grind\"\nDawg, I'm tellin' it like it is, you gotta deal with the consequence\nWhen you run in a nigga's crib, nigga, you better be ready to sit\n[Chorus]\nDope dealers, street hustlers, pop cases\nThrow dice, on pavement, cop chases\nBig gamblers, skullies, hide faces\nGang wars, hot spots, police raid it\nLeft 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)\nLeft 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)\n\n[Verse 2]\nPick a down on his luck rapper, bet he broke\nWith the arrogance of a crackhead mad at a weed smoker\nOr a pill taker who hate a distilled wine drinker\nA killer who use a gun to hate on a knife swinger\nAight, I get it, it's who the littest, we in competition\nY'all did it first'll be the death, I got a proposition\nYou and your brothers stop plottin' on each other, plot on millions\nEducate yourself, find ten different areas of interest\nSpread your bets out\nDouble down on what's working then you double up\nHands on your paper, they sending hate no matter what you touch\nHonestly, I'm speechless\nFly to Greece, twenty pointers on the chain, I freaked it\nLawn chair in the hood, sittin' comfortably\nI must be insane givin' you bars runnin' companies\nI'm done with the redundancies, checking on my history\nMaking content for Viacom, license music to Tiffany's\nI come from\n[Chorus]\nDope dealers, street hustlers, pop cases\nThrow dice, on pavement, cop chases\nBig gamblers, scullies, hide faces\nGang wars, hot spots, police raid it\nLeft 'em speechless (Speechless)\nJust like when the judge read the sentence\nThrew your life away in minutes\nLeft 'em speechless (Speechless)\nThe bounce back the greatest feeling\nWhen they thought that you was finished\nLeave 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)\nSpeechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)8Embed"

    "lyrics": "Dedicated Lyrics[Intro]\nBack by popular demand, it's Magic\nDed\u2014, ded\u2014, dedicated (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen Carlito was dying\nHe see the shadow of his girl dancing with the baby\nLike, \"Fuck it, it's my time\", but if God save me\nMaybe I'll erase any vice that could potentially bring harm to me\nBefore I make a move, I think about it karmically\nEverything come back like a boomerang\nI'm black as Paul Mooney slang\nAnd all I pray for is health and a sustainable business\nAnd a faithful missus\nI see a lot of people try to be who they ain't\nWe don't want money that fit in the bag, we want the bank\nJust to spread it around lik\u0435 icing on the cake\nWhite tig\u0435r out the cage, Mike Tyson in '88\nDedicated like jack boys on Melrose\nSmash and grab, yo, this world became a hellhole\nStay cool is what I tell those (Word) youngins\nSo they don't end up in jail clothes, come on\n[Chorus]\nI dedicated my life, my life\nDedicated my life, my life (Dedicated)\nI dedicated my\u2014 (My)\nUh, uh (You know what that is? It's the inspiration)\nDedicated my\u2014 (Uh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhole damn life\nIf I wanted to now, I could live an old man life\nConfronted with how the hood can use more funding\nMore budgets for more teachers, financial literacy, more speeches\nChefs come cook for me\nLook what it took for me, the streets had its hooks in me\nYeah, people ask me what books to read\nDestruction of Black civilization, that's history\nJournal of Chris Columbus, that is what interests me\nJuneteenth holiday finally came and it pisses me\nOff for the fact that we came in chains, you'll be physically in pain\nDedicated like Ricky Walters, Dougie and Dana Dane\n\n[Chorus]\nI dedicated my life, my life\nI dedicated my life, my life (Dedicated)\nI dedicated my\u2014, ah\nDedicated my (Dedicated)\nI dedicated my life, my life\nI dedicated my life, my life\nI dedicated my\u2014\n[Beat Switch]\n\n[Interlude]\nTest, test, yeah, you know?\nTo get to this point\nI might have to write a script, a manuscript\nYo, yo\n\n[Verse 3]\nGhetto manners, is you thuggin' me or asking?\nFinessin' me or pressin' me? Well none of that is happenin'\nAccessory to murder, not necessarily Manson\nI'm just a G in constructs, a Pelle Pel' or a Vanson\nRatty clothes, we haven't spoke in years, pat his coat\nCheck his waistline, he spyin' on who has the most\nBest to leave me alone, I get in my zone\nLaughin' with African presidents while over the phone\nShit be feeling like the last days, cash made\nMirrors on the ceiling with a bad babe\nSame age but niggas be having mad grays\nMillion Man March for real niggas, never last place\nBlazin' gats like young Haitian Jack\nMe and money go together like the 80s and crack\nShorty aura like Kimora rockin' Baby Phat\nI'm droppin bars nigga like I'm on stage with Smack\nTo my niggas who have staples from the navel up\nHealed up, had to chill a while, lay in the cut\nShorty tried to WAP me down in the Mercedes truck\nPulled up, cobblestone ground in my palatial hut\nParadis for niggas still doing deals in the street\nOriginal Backwoods, I fill 'em with green\nAm I a musician or am I a magician?\nNo tricks, just real shit straight out the kitchen\n[Outro]\nPure magic\nNo tricks, no tricks\nNo tricks\nNo tricks, pure magic (Magic, magic, magic, magic, magic)5Embed"
