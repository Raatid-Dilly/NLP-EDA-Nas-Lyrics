    "lyrics": "I Miss You Lyrics[Intro]\n[ I know if you could hear me you would\nSay there are always two sides of a story\nYou're so right, here's mine\nI cannot live without you ]\n\n[Verse 1]\nLove was never easy\nBut leaving you was hard\nAnd time didn't heal my wounds at all\nI wonder, if you know what I'm going through\nAll the lonely times that we're apart\n[Chorus]\nI miss you, oh I miss you\nI'm gonna need you more and more each day\nI miss you, more than words can say\nMore than words can ever say\n\n[Verse 2]\nSaying sorry was a question of my pride\nPride can push aside a loving heart\nIn the end emotion has ruled my mind\nAnd I'm asking for a second start\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[ Maybe I've said words that really didn't\nMean, but I know, every day\nWhen a man does wrong\nI know I miss you ]\n\n[Chorus]Embed"
