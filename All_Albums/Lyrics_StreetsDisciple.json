The Redd Foxx's?\nNever got Emmy's but were real to me\nLet's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels\nCause they said they played they parts well\nNow they claim caviar, hate that oxtail\nLambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel\nWhitey always tell him, \"Ooh, he speak so well\"\nAre you the one we look to, the decent Negro?\nThe acceptable Negro? Hell nah\nBut they say \"These are our heroes\"\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nUh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play\nAthletes of today in the NBA, make me proud\nBut there's somethin' they don't say\nKeep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay\nFrom OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe\nFirst he played his life cool just like Michael\nNow he rock ice too just like I do\nYo, you can't do better than that?\nThe hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?\nNow you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back\nYeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you\nYou turn around then you shit on Shaq\nWho woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes\nHe love a little butt crack, got enough cash\nLittle kids with they bus pass who look up to you\nTo do something for the youth, stupid spoof\nBut you let them use you as an example\nThey would rep, but our heroes got they hands full\n\n[Hook: Nas]\nLet's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB\nWho 'Yes Massa' on TV\nWhat ever happened to Wheezy?

You talk Black\nBut your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque\nYou don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface\nYou don't know what you feel, y'all too safe\nElection done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it\nHuh, and in the end we all got dicked\nThese are our heroes, thanks a lot, public school systems still rot\nStill harassed by cops, snitches on blocks\nSellin they peoples out, some real folks with clout\nTavis Smiley, Michael Eric Dyson\nStokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them\nNicky Giovanni poetical black female\nJim Brown to the people who sing well from\nFela to Miriam Makeba\nThe mirror says you are the next American leader\nSo don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records\nThese pickaninnies get with anything to sell records\nCause it's trendy to be the conscious MC\nBut next year, who knows what we'll see?\nHa-ha... these are our heroes\n\n[Hook: Nas]\nLet's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB\nWho 'Yes Massa' on TV\nWhat ever happened to Wheezy?

Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife\nHe's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night\nLittle bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz\nIn her pad while she slept\nThey said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister\nNigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next\n\n[Hook: Emily]\nEmily harmonizes as Nas talks:\n\"Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what\nTry to conquer all. So what? To all my niggas with they\nKids that love they kids, man. All the daddies out there\nTo all the niggas that died tryin'a figure out what's what\nTryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know. Yeah, yeah\nLadies forgive us. Gotta forgive us. For we know not what\nWe do. Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and\nShit. Just man... man.\"3Embed"

Chapter 1\n\n[Verse]\nJanuary 28, 1968\nBorn into this world, William Griffin The Great\nChapter 1, Wyandanch, Long Island\nScientific rhyming invented a new style when\nHe met with Eric Barrier from East Elmhurst\nThe melody they created was the first\nBurst on the scene 1986, with clap to this\n'87 dropped a classic disc\nThe facts is the tracklist was like full\nThe vocals, the beats, according to Marley Marl\nRecorded in my hometown Queensbridge\nThat's why it's so relative\nThis biography was unauthorized\nI spit it how it was given to author Nas\nWilliam changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah\nCause Clarence 13X had New York on lock\nGods on every block, jams in every park\nI remember hearing Kurtis Blow saying\n\"It can't get better than this\"\n'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits\nFrom leather coats to shell toes to the Stan Smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks\nFirst million-dollar deal ever in rap\n18th Letter did that\nFrom 4th & Broadway to Uni to MCA\nWe followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre\nSupreme, Rap and the 50 that don't rap\nFort Greene, Queens, Strong Island wolfpack\nPaid In Full posse, hot they was on\nAnd Ra had his firstborn\nWith the next line I'ma be easy\nHis wisdom's name is Fifi\nEPMD put a record out, was dope\nTension spread, and I quote\n\"Smack me and I smack you back\"\nSounded like the answer to the \"I Ain't No Joke\" track\nFor a second it ain't look good\nLittle tension buzzing from Wyandanch to Brentwood\nMisunderstood, all forgot\nAt sixteen when I met Freddie Foxxx\nToting burners, the whole coast's most concern was\nHow has Rakim's flow made Christians convert with Islamic ways\nLet The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP\nA sophisticated mean one\nBefore similar voices were King Sun\nA few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom\nAt sixteen, son was watching him, mesmerized\nRespect, not jocking him, was so amazing, besides\nHe came on the stage with lasers in his eyes\nWalk with me now\n[Outro]\nUnauthorized Biography of Rakim\nEpilogue: Mother was a jazz singer\nNephew to R & B legend Ruth Brown\nDiscography: Paid In Full, Follow The Leader, Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em, Don't Sweat The Technique\nThat's the end of the group, went on for solo\nDropped \"The R\", then The 18th Letter, then I think something, The Master\nWas signed to Aftermath\nScheduled to release an album Oh My God with Dr. Dre\nThe album was dismantled because of creative differences\nThe end\nTo the new beginning, yeah\nNext book, KRS-One.

I DO\nSike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin to\nI'm getting married\n[Hook]\n\nI'm getting married\n\n[Produced by Chucky Thompson]2Embed"

No\nMy chauffeur driver just left some of my colleagues smoking that Cali\nCaught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window\nKinda' see my father's features creeping in a little\nGot an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica\nTell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her\nAnd I'm late to a date with my wife, I realize\nI stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise\nAnd I'm walking through it, chaos is all around me\nBut God got me, no fear, through the fire, try and stop me\n[Chorus 2: Keon Bryce]\nThere's a war in the streets tonight\nAnd all this drama's got me feeling uptight\nI don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo\nCause she's standing on the corner of Linden Boulevard\nHolding our baby in her baby in her arms\nSo hold on, your daddy's in sight\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nYeah, nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes\nFor the first time, praise God, baby mom's crying\nPlanned to be a strong black family\nBut we both were too young, too strung, too much flashing\nNewcomer called Verbal Assassin running with\nNothing but the worst type, worst fight\nWhen we brought my baby home the first night\nCursed like sailors, burst out the crib raging\nIn my new car bought from entertainment\nChampagne and gaining clout fast, whiplash\nDid this bitch just pass in the club hugged up, stupid ass\nGrabbed her by the pony tail, \"never disrespect me\"\nI'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi\nMoved back to your grandma, I'm single, the Land's mine\nShe keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again\nSqueezing the pen, released again, chart toppers\nHard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems\nNew woman, she's great, this a different world\nChecking out my wife's chemistry with my little girl\nIt's so amazing, playing, life is so crazy\nI'm grown up and thankful for lessons God gave me\n[Chorus 1: Keon Bryce]\nThere's a war in the streets tonight\nAnd nobody's really feeling alright\nI got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic\nI know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down\n'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown\nAnd I know it's not my time to go now\n'Cause God's got my back in this showdown\nSo I know we'll be alright\n\n[Music changes]\n\n[Outro: Unknown speaker]\nFrom the day you was born...\nYour daughter Destiny, was one of your destinations...5Embed"
