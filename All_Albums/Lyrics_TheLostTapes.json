Prob'ly on the island\nProject call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger\nPlayin' corners, stick the elevator never thought\nProject life would promise nothin' but to die trife\nFor steppin' on the next man's Nikes, my motto: look for tomorrow\nToday is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way\nGats spray, these shorties is killers\nThe older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller\nAnd they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in\nLike 'who's you?' when I cruise through\nI call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends\nBe clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever\n[Chorus]\nEverything will eventually come to an end\nSo try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?\nThe beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better\n'Cause nothin' lasts forever, ya know? Yo\nEverything will eventually come to an end\nSo try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?\nThe beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better\n'Cause nothin' lasts forever (Yo)\n\n[Verse 2]\nNice cars, livin' like a star, club-hoppin'\nPoppin' bottles at the bar, love shoppin'\nGucci iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs\nOne for your wife, one for your freak\nSilver-spurs Rolls Royce, too good to be true, houses worth 2.2\nPool parties, beautiful view\nYou made it in life, Forbes Magazine style, baggy jeans style\nPass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile\nAsses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses\nLouis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'\nThinkin', \"Damn, wish my niggas could afford this\"\nOn the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless\nTalkin' to lawyers, accountants, investments\nMoney doubles, triples, protect it: hard work you manifested\nWorries of failure, when you buried is your familia\nGon' keep your name prosperin' to the maximum?\nYou should live, there's only one life, that's the physical\nRich or poor or in jail, why the fuck should you be miserable?\nThings happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'\nLove could have your heartbeat skippin', thugs turn to religion\nThe bitch you love could start to hate you\nThe shit you used to do escape you\nThings that make you laugh represent the past\nReminisce the block, gamble Gs on the floor\nNiggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more\nYour favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down\nTurned 'em into shopping malls, the hood is like a ghost town\nHaunted by souls who thought that time stood still\nJust live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real\n[Chorus]\nEverything must eventually come to an end\nSo try to savor your moments, 'cause time flies, don't it?\nThe beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better\n'Cause nothin' lasts forever, ya know?\nEverything will eventually come to an end\nSo try to savor your moments, 'cause time flies, don't it?\nThe beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better\n'Cause nothin' lasts forever\n\n[Outro]\nYa know? Ya know? Nothin' lasts forever, ya know?\nLet it go, let it go6Embed"

Can't decide, that's a hard one\nI mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled\nHeadline readin' \"Rapper Slain From a Man Shootin'\"7Embed"

Not enough land, not enough homes\nNot enough banks, to give my brother a loan\nWhat do we own? The skin on our backs, we rent and we ask\nFor reparations, then they hit us with tax\nAnd insurance if we live to be old, what about now?\nSo stop being controlled, we black zombies\n[Chorus]\nWalking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)\nWe just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)\nWalking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)\nWe just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAyo, we trapped in our own brain, fucked behind bars\nWe've already gone insane\nWe've already gave up, cut our own heads offs\nStab our own backs and dream too much\nWithout fulfilling reality; too greedy and\nCan't have one or two chains, we need three of them\nCan't have one or two guns without squeezing 'em\nOn our own people and, fuck black leaders\n'Cause whites ain't got none leading them, the rhythm is cosmic\nNas is divinity, the deity's prophet\nLet's all get down and get up\nVictims walking 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck\nFainting, shouting, catching Holy Ghost in church\nScared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doing it first\nWe begged, we prayed, petitioned and demonstrated\nJust to make another generation - black zombies\n\n[Chorus]\nWalking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)\nWe just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)\nWalking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)\nWe just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)\n[Verse 3]\nYou scared to be yourself, 'cause you in a trance\nFeel free, hear the music and dance\nIf you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you\nDumb niggas with long beards like they Arabs or Jews\nOr from Israel, Bismillah al rahman al rahim\nIslam's a beautiful thing\nAnd Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring\nPeace against the darkness, which is ungodly\nSo what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?\nUse your own intuition, you are tomorrow\n{*roaring*} .. That's the sound of the beast\nI'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid\nControl your own destiny, you are a genius\nDon't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie\n\n[Chorus]\nWalking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)\nWe just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)\nWalking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)\nWe just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)\n\n[Outro:]\nWake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years\nGhetto niggas won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?\nWhy listen to somebody else tell you how to do it\nWhen you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it\nDo it niggas.. c'mon, uhh, peace...7Embed"

Don't tell your mother what's going down\"\nPoppa was a playa, playa was in poppa\nPoppa loved the ladies, never got enough of\nThe pretty brown round, running round town\n\"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo many kids I knew, never knew who Pop was\nThat's why I show my pop love\n'Cause he was still around when I popped up\nHe could have left my moms pregnant, shook to death, but stayed\nWatched me crawl 'til I took my first step, to the first grade\nTo my first fistfight, right behind me, he would stand\nNo matter how big or tall, he made me fight you like a man\nThrow dirt in ya eye, swing my right, scoop your ass and slam\nHe watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam\nRoaches of weed all over my crib, him and moms relaxing\nNext thing you know he packing, so then I asked him\n\"What's this white shit on that plate and your face?\nAnd, Poppa, why you butt-ass from the waist\nAnd, who's this lady I'm facing?\nDark skin, you not my mommy!\"\nHe grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me\nPromised me things that he would buy me\nIf I kept my mouth closed and don't tell Mommey\nHe said one day I'll understand\u2014\n\"Little me, what's in you is inside me\"\n[Chorus]\nPoppa was a playa, playa was in poppa\nPoppa loved the ladies, never got enough of\nThe pretty brown round, running round town\n\"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down\"\nPoppa was a playa, playa was in poppa\nPoppa loved the ladies, never got enough of\nThe pretty brown round, running round town (Ugh, my nigga)\n\"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nPops told me hold my own, Pops told me value home\nCould I help it, \"Papa Was a Rolling Stone\"?\nWho loved the pretty brown round, out-of-town-bound\nTrumpet in his jazz band, he touring\nAt home, I played his latest recordings\nAnd it's strange how I do my thing now, I'm in the game now\nInherited his brainpower, to pull strings and gain power\nOur weed habits the same now\nNo white lines, or trumpets, just tight rhymes\nAnd beats that's bumpin, 'fore he left, he taught me something\nA child's young years the most important time to be there\nThat's why he stayed 'til we grew up, respect is still here\nI'm older now, see what having a father's about\nOne day they can be in your life, next day, they be out\nIt's not because of you, you know the deal\nHim and your moms feel\nIf they stay together, then someone will get killed\nI love you still, always will, 'cause that's my nigga\nAlthough you felt you was wrong, I still feel you, kid\nLife goes on...8Embed"

    "lyrics": "Fetus Lyrics[Intro]\nYeah..\nI want all my niggas to come journey with me\nMy name is Nas, and the year is 1973\nBeginning of me, therefore, I could see\nThrough my belly button window, who I am...\n\n[Verse 1]\nI existed in a womb, just like an abyss\nCame from behind the sun, my hands balled in a fist\nPunching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix\nTwitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose\nWas to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain\nBut to take on a name, my pops chose for me\nBloodstream full of indo, developing eyes\nNine-months process, infant size\nA prophet in his early stages, mother in her early thirties\nWas married to pops, wishing what she carried would drop\nI'm not worthy to come from a woman so pure, Ann Jones\nFlesh of her flesh, blood of her blood, her blood and bones\nHearing prayers, she asking for my good health\nThat I'd become a man and learn to make a way for myself\nNervous she was, and her paranoia got in my blood\nMixed with marijuana from my daddy's genes\nLot of screams I'm hearing, it's crazy, both parents is scrapping\nI'm not even a baby, a miscarriage could happen\n[Chorus]\nI shot my way out my mom dukes\nI shot my way out my mom dukes\nI shot my way out my mom dukes\nI shot my way out my mom dukes\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, they must wanna keep me, 'cause four months pass, I'm still alive\nGuess I got what you call an Ill Will to survive\nWhen I look hard, the lights is killing my eyes\nI know when moms layin down, I get bored, start to get live\nMove side to side, hear loud music and vibe\nAll black babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie\nSolar energize, mineralize food flowing through my mother's tube\nI'm covered in this thick layer of goo\nMonth two was the least most comfortable\nMy umbilical cord choking me, but month three was closer, see\nThat's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic\nBut I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute\nWatching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well\nFeared fist fights, so terrified when we fell\nWhile they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall\nI wondered, \"If I am born, will I be safe at all?\"\nThis place they call the world though my view was so large\nCouldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge\nMonth five, month six went by, hoping I'm born in July\nBut the Lord already figured out a date and time\nSeptember 14th, 73\nGet ready, world, doctor's in the front waiting for me\nArms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gon' stop\nSee how the government start retraining cops\nMonth nine, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced\nPops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too\nSaid \"Stay calm,\" holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on\nSurgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out\nEverything is blurry, my first breath screams out\nTears pouring down my pops face, he's so proud\nWanting to hold me, but I was so bloody\nThey washed me off and he say, \"At least that nigga ain't ugly\"\nPlaced me in his arms snugly, laid me on my mother\nFinally, I got to see who held me in her body, she loved me\nAnd yo, I plan to overthrow the Devil\nAnd y'all bout to see this world in trouble, motherfuckers\n{*Doctor slaps the baby; the baby screams*}10Embed"
