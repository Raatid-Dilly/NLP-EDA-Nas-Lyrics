League\n\n[Verse 1]\nPS 111 had free lunch\nEmbarrassed but managed to get a plate...\nWe was kids hungry\nMom's working, I was famished\nShe getting home late...\nSo I decided now I'm in charge\nEither stay full or starve\nCorner store like \"Mister, spare-a-quarter\"\nBefore Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars\nTrying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard\nRoll with a shooting squad\nHow could I not succumb? How could I not partake?\nFifteen, I got a gun\nSixteen, I robbed a train\nLicked off a shot for fun\nWhat's got inside my brain?\nA hustler's job ain't done, til he becomes a king\nBut I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the midst of\nDudes who switch up and change\nThey wanna carry me like I'm some kind of lame\nI never let them though, I just forgive them though\nEither that or the pistol blow\n[Break: sample]\n\"Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!\nY'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember early mornings, syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah\nWalking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah\nWorth two hundred million now\nBicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums\nBrazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties\nI'm pushing forty, she only twenty-one\nDon't applaud me, I'm exhausted G\nMe and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup\nY'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut\nRemember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck\nSaid stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani\nHood forever, I just act like I'm civilized\nReally what's in my mind is organizing a billion Black motherfuckers\nTo take over J.P. and Morgan, Goldman and Sachs\nAnd teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back\n\n[Break: sample]\n\"Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!\nY'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!\"\n\n[Verse 3]\n1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him\nGone a few years, the whole world snoring on him\nGirls all up on him\nI spread em, hit 'em and dead 'em\nShe says, third leg from a legend is sheer heaven\nShe says, it is the greatest loving\nThe tales you hear is the truth on me\nWho wasn't the most faithful husband\nReveal my life, you will forgive me\nYou will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me\nOnly a few will, this how it sounds when you're too real\nThey think it's just music still\nWell I am a graphic classic song composer\nMusic notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure\nSome of y'all might know Kelis, this goes to her with love\nAlso goes to y'all, let's see\nThe craziest things already happened to me\nSo either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, ha\n[Break: sample]\n\"Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!\nY'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!\"18Embed"

Blige]\nThis kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove\nReach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby\nI see you standing there\nSo lost and all alone\nI wanna take you in my arms\nAnd tell you that you\u2019re home\nI look into your eyes\nI said I know you very well\nI see a mirror of my life\nA reflection of myself\n[Verse 1: Nas]\n3:45AM can't sleep, can't dream\nI'm stuck, money problems pop up\nHow will I survive?\nGuess it's best to decide not to decide\nSo that's my decision\nWhatever happens happens\nI keep making my millions\nCan see myself in Presidential campaign dinners\nBut I'm passing blunts around a bunch of gang members\nWhen you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles\nAnd you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you\nAnd you become better than legends you thought were the greatest\nAnd outgrow women you loved and thought you could stay with\nLife become clearer when you wipe down your mirror\nAnd leave notes around for yourself to remember\nI like to teach and build\nWith brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil\nAll you need is some skill, then it\u2019s grind time\nImagination better than knowledge, says Einstein\nIt\u2019s all in the mind\nNasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic\nJust one minute after it's heard\nYou all'll recite it, you all'll repeat it\nYou'll call me a genius, if you didn't\nNow that I said it I forced you to think it\nWrite in my little vignettes, sipping Mo\u00ebt\nBitch when you vision me, you vision the best\nWhen I was young they called me Olu's son\nNow he's Nas' father, I was the good seed\nHe was the wise gardener\n[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]\nThis kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove\nReach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby\nI see you standing there\nSo lost and all alone\nI wanna take you in my arms\nAnd tell you that you\u2019re home\nI look into your eyes\nI said I know you very well\nI see a mirror of my life\nA reflection of myself\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nYeah, what y'all know about this..\nYo, beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas\nConservatives don\u2019t understand slang linguistics\nThe burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness\nLove the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness\nSo what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious\nGet out a gangsta's business, seems to me your thoughts are basic\nTry to compare what you live to the life I master\nSee the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after\nBig bracelets, golden Egyptian faces\nWhite wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation\nThe strip club scene favors Josephine Baker\nDope fiend neighbors, growing up I seen paper\nI describe it, hope you can visualize it\nThis is reminiscent to all the parks in the project\nWhen my British Knights can rival your Foamposites\nDon\u2019t make me pull my Lottos out the closet\nHa ha ha\n[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]\nThis kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove\nReach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby\nI see you standing there\nSo lost and all alone\nI wanna take you in my arms\nAnd tell you that you\u2019re home\nI look into your eyes\nI said I know you very well\nI see a mirror of my life\nA reflection of myself\n\n[Outro: Mary J.

We was friends, we had it all\nReason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault\nHe in the grave \u2013 let it go, he no longer living\nSaid you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women\nFuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck\nBirkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up\nNo matter who you fuck, that was before me\nWanted you as my shorty since I saw you screaming\n\"Hate you so much right now\"\nShould've saw the meaning, angry black woman\nActions of a demon, I'm leaving\n[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)\nYou know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nBye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave\nSeven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed\nLet's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years\nYou and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird\nSame time, different year, I was digging y'all flow\nThen I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know\nI thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches\nI was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin\nYet the cuter version, yet I knew you personally\nBetter than you knew yourself \u2013 and I knew this for certain\nCrib in the Dominican, you got away from everybody\nYou screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably\nThe highlight of my life, like \"Ha, yo, look at my wife!\"\nGangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night\nBailed you out, next morning we got clean\nLike it never happened, and later we at that Heat game\nJust another day in the life of two people in love\nBut it wasn't enough, so baby, guess what...\n[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)\nOH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)\nI can't believe that this is happening to us\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nListen, could you imagine writing your deposition\nDivorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?\nWith you paying out the ass and I'm talking half\nNot some, but half, no, serious, half\nHalf of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind\nIt\u2019s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind\nAnd all I seen was selfish cowards\nUnder their breath, saying, \"Why did Nas trust her?\"\nBut look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!\nYou live with your baby moms\nAnd scared to make an honest woman out of her\nAnd make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even alive\nAt least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride\nPlus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride\nHe got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes\nNext go round I hope I pick the truest type\nAnd watch me do it all again \u2013 it\u2019s a beautiful life, aight?\nGoodbye!\n[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]\n(Bye baby) Baby.. baby\nYou know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)\nI can't believe that this is happening to us\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing\nYou know I'm saying bye-bye\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby\n\n[Outro: Guy sample]\n'Til we make love just one more time\nMake it seem forever\nThis is our last and final goodbye\nGoodbye16Embed"

My gun off safety\nSince the Tunnel and Skate Key, my jewelry in HD\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nSilent rage, pristine in my vintage shades\nI'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage\nI am the dragon\nMaserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend\nBlastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans\nMy little Jackie Onassis, dig?\nI'm so high I never land like Mike Jackson's crib\nVest on, .45 still crack ya rib, sacrilege\nTalk trash 'bout the Nasty kid\nPast nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive\nTalk money, is you jokin'?\nCash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa\nIn the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket\nOn the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got it\nYou envy, but don't offend me\nI'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley\nYou are your car, what could represent me?\nToo Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly\nMust design me somethin' Tommy Montana from Queens had before the 90's\nDrug dealer car, rush to the bar\nMove, niggas! We don't give a fuck who you are\nBlack card heavy like a magnet in my stitched denims\nPretty women see them saggin'\nBet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back\nJust havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black\nLight another blunt in fact, haha...\n[Interlude: Nas]\n(Nasty) Nasty kid\n(Nasty) Yeah...\n(Nasty) The kid!

When we all know you pumpkin pie\nWhen we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates\nTo Dubai, to the Chi, I'm a crucial conflict\nHeaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out\nYou are what a thug about, I'm a fucking juggernaut\nNever sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up\nWho don't speak, she quiet\nSo I can think, conspire\nOn my feet's a (?), and sometimes sneakers\nWear ties at the Setai Miami\nTime-pieces are from Zurich\nIt\u2019s like I'm allergic, to Nonoxynol 9\nGive it to you raw so you can feel it9Embed"

Homes, you're done\nWhat have we become? Rap stars from trap stars\nBlack gods to Ansars to Sunnis back to goonies\nA 360 in the streets real grizzly\nShooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning\nStudent enrollment to focus, yet hooligans roll with\nToasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders\nThis ain't The Truman Show; it's the human show\nAsk the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle\nChewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you\nIt's U.S.A. against the gangsta, where's the love?\n[Chorus: Cocaine 80s]\nLove, I'll trade you love\nI've traded fire with you long enough\nIs that all you brung, without love?\nThat's fucked up, but I saved your soul\nRoll that up\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nSometimes I sit on the bench just to watch the game\nFeet on cement, there ain't a mobster living I could name\nWho made it out rich, in his absence I do not proclaim\nTo not have a heart like wild animals not tamed\nMaybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank\n'Cept I had a vision above niggas, what I think\nIt's crazy how many brothers come where I come from\nSome made it out big, some dead, some unsung\nShots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up\nYounger generation, they want to mimic and mock us\nLaughing, separating themselves like they not us, like\n\"Cops'll look at you like they look at me? That's preposterous\"\nAin't it gangsta how your man made it? I'm humble\nOne gun, one crazy ass nigga, that's Jungle\nNow we having babies, 'cause growing up it was just us\nNo uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was fucked up\nBut still it was beautiful, the love is mutual\nEven though me and Jung ain't show up to your funeral\nI hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you\nYour pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to\nThe G is in your genes, already you tuck\nInherit your dad's swag, his George Jefferson's strut\nStay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet\nDon't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit\nTell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise\nNo matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor\nI'm a street corner nigga, New York Knicks loyalist\nCorona sipper, pass it, I'ma blow it with you\nIt ain't The Truman show; it's the human show\nAs the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle\nChews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you\nYoung brother go and get your paper, I got love\n[Chorus: Cocaine 80s]\nLove, I'll trade you love\nI've traded fire with you long enough\nIs that all you brung, without love?\nThat's fucked up, but I saved your soul\nRoll that up\n... Roll that up8Embed"

    "lyrics": "Trust Lyrics[Intro]\nIt's like a cold story.. repeated over and over\nIn the winters of my mind, yeah\nThis shit be real, man..\nShit's crazy out here..\nYo yo, yo what up y'all?\nThat's my niggas over there, word\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers\nI could tell the future of a dude how his stance is\nWonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is\nIs he gon' cock it and pop it? His waistband big\nBut he don't have that thing in him, slangin just ain't in him\nBody language is off, he's soft\nBut soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'\n'Cause he feel a way: my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway\nOne look could tell me if you really came to kill me\nBe the quiet nigga lookin' lame with the milli\nWho that over there creepin'? Who homie by the tree?\nBetter safe than sorry, look at p-noid me\nFew machine guns close, we could squeeze all three\nBe a cold day in hell 'fore they creep on me\nIt\u2019s a lesson every premonition\nLot of niggas killed 'cause they wasn't payin' attention, listen\n[Chorus]\nI want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust\nAccountants lookin' over my figures I can trust\nA lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust\nDamn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough\nOr Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust\nGoons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust\nAnd if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?\nSome of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's been so long, can\u2019t remember how we begun this war\nThis is a ever-lasting thunderstorm, 'cause guns went off\nI see your moms, she still speak\nShe don't know I ain't cool with her son no more\nIt\u2019s old shit, see forever we holdin' this grudge\nTakes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs\nWe buried our dead, been years, why should I worry 'bout him?\nConstantly watchin' my back, plus niggas tellin' I dread\nAnother day I put a family in black\nThough I be calm and relaxed\nThough I know somehow it will come back\nEven if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life\nWhat was it worth to see you covered in dirt?\nIt\u2019s quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted\nMothers cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide\nJust tattoos of my niggas' names\nI wonder, will it change? Let's ride\u2026\n[Chorus]\nI want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust\nAccountants lookin' over my figures I can trust\nA lawyer that\u2019s fightin' for my decisions I can trust\nDamn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough\nOr Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust\nGoons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust\nAnd if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?\nSome of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position\nA caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions\nFrom the mind of a man who went at it with killers\nSit down, little man, let me school you in hood business\nSeen a lot of niggas blow, lot of dreams folded\nSome wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated\nAin't too much left to buy, bought it, I'm loaded, I guess\nLear jets, I ask myself: do I need love or success?\nThey say the artist that truly suffers, his stuff is the best\n'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve: pain, pistols and sex\nRemember spray paintin' the word \"fresh\" and then starin' at it\nOlder folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it\nBuildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the McLaren past it\nSame old man from years ago told me life is short\nSo from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment\nLive with it and love it\n[Chorus]\nI want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust\nAccountants lookin' over my figures I can trust\nA lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust\nDamn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough\nOr Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust\nGoons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust\nAnd if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?\nSome of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more10Embed"
