The cops gon' bust you.\"\nI was a teen drunk off brew\nStumbled I wondered if God sent him\n'Cause two squad cars entered the block\nAnd looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched\nI took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair\nStarin' at a young disciple\nI almost gave my life to what the dice do\nYeah man, throwin' them bones\nHopin' my ace get his case thrown\nHis girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'\nWhile he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'\nThey little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof\nThe D.A. who tried him was lyin'\nA white dude, killed his mother during the case\nHung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced\nPre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier\nWalks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild\nTriple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle\nI wanna crack a smile when I see him\nThrow up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom\nHe grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'\nThen he grabbed the judge, screams out, \"Nobody leavin'\nEverybody\u2014\"\n[Chorus: James Brown sample]\nGet down, get down! Get down, get down!\nGet, get, get, get, get, get, get down!\nEverybody\nGet down, get down! Get down, get down!\nGet, get, get, get, get, get, get down!\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nSome niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em\nWeird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em\nThey make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget\nSold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs\nSouthern niggas, independent label, real killers\nKnow the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'\nThey had the coke game somethin' crazy\nSold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me\nPut me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'\nTook a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him\nSouthern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me\nI left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy\nNow I'm back around the old school that raised me\nNew York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see\nA dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay\nThe letter say, \"Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play.\"\nI rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral\nNever saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho\nResponsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital\nMidnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too\nSee, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs\nHe plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano\nGave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano\nShe passed me the indigo, but the imbecile\nShoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed\nOpenin' the hotel room door to let her goons in\nBut I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit\nI let the hammers blow, wet three kids\nSee honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama\n'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed\nCalled up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you\nHe responded \"cool,\" but told me out here this how motherfuckers\u2014\n[Chorus: James Brown sample]\nGet down, get down! Get down, get down!\nGet, get, get, get, get, get, get down!\nEverybody\nGet down, get down! Get down, get down!\nGet, get, get, get, get, get, get down!\n\n[Outro: Salaam Remi]\nAll I really gotta say is that\nIf that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?\nHow we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?\nA shame when you really look at it\nMy folk against your folk, but we all kinfolk\nSomebody got to make a change37Embed"

Yeah, I been that\nYou know I click-clack \u2014 where you and your mens at?\nDo the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat\nRooftop like we bringin' '88 back\n[Chorus]\nThey shootin'!

Aw, made you look\nYou a slave to a page in my rhyme book\nGettin' big money, playboy, your time's up\nWhere them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis ain't rappin', this is Street Hop\nNow get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot\nMy live niggas lit up the reefer\nTrunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper\nDon't start none, won't be none\nNo reason for your mans to panic\nYou don't wanna see no ambulances\nKnock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup\nThat's the way you get Timberland'd up\nLet the music defuse all the tension\nBaller convention, free admission\nHustlers, dealers and killers can move swift\nGirls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept\nAll my just-comin' homies, parolees\nGet money, leave the beef alone slowly\nGet out my face, you people so phony\nPull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty\n[Chorus]\nThey shootin'! Aw, made you look\nYou a slave to a page in my rhyme book\nGettin' big money, playboy, your time's up\nWhere them gangstas? Where them dimes at?\nThey shootin'!

Where them dimes at?\n\n[Verse 3]\nI see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude\nI lay you out, show you what steel do\nMobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges\nEvery invitation to fight you punk chazzers\nLike Pun said: you ain't even en mi clasa\nMaybach Benz, back seat, TV plasma\nLadies lookin' for athletes or rappers\nWhatever you choose, whatever you do\nMake sure he a thug and intelligent too\nLike a real thoroughbred is\nShow me love, let me feel how the head is\nFemales who's the sexiest is always the nastiest\n\n[Outro]\nAnd I like a little sassiness\nA lot of class; Mami, reach in your bag, pass the fifth\nI'm a leader at last, this a don you with\nMy 9's will spit, niggas lose consciousness25Embed"

Fuck that shit, the first you'll be last\nI'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper\nG-O-D, S-O-N \u2013 they'll be none after\nI was Scarface, Jay was Manolo\nIt hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo...\nUhh, uhh, uhh\n[Chorus]\nLord have mercy, Jesus Christ\nHe's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu\nLook at the life that I've been through\nI'm the last real nigga alive, that's official\nLord have mercy, Jesus Christ\nHe's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu\nLook at the life that I've been through\nI'm the last real nigga alive, that's official13Embed"

Lyrics[Intro: Nas]\nI want you to close your eyes\nAnd vision the most beautiful place in the world\nIf you in the hood on the ghetto street corner\nCome on this journey, the best journey\nA mansion, acres of land and swimming pools and all that\nCheck it out\n\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nI'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings\nTo fly like doves over the streets, watchin' many things\nKids walkin' home from school on drug blocks\nMissionaries pass out papers that read \"Love God\"\nI see faces, cases, judges, and juries, Masons, lawyers and cops\nI watch because every thug's face is my mirror\nBut this was one in particular\nThis kid, he was the vintage stick 'em up pro\nSixteen years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go\nEvery morning, calls his comrade to come and get him to smoke\nHe insane, already gone mad blames himself for his setbacks\nDangerous street corners where it sets at\nSlang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs\nChasin' him, his asthma's flarin'\nSmokin' like a chimney, on Remy, of course he not carin'\nHe need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'\nI give him a helping hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion\n[Chorus: J. Phoenix]\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, 'cause it's all good\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright\nNothing but peace, love, and street passion\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nDear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good\nTell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods\nSeen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook\nDrippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke\nThen some lady named Billie Holiday sang\nSittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came\nLittle LaTasha sho' grown\nTell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home\nMaybe in time you'll understand\nOnly God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band\nJust think of all the people that you knew in the past\nThat passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last\nPicture a place that they exist, together\nThere has to be a place better than this, in Heaven\nSo right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'\nRemember this face, save me a place in Thugz Mansion\n[Chorus: J. Phoenix]\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, 'cause it's all good\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright\nNothing but peace, love, and street passion\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nA place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide\nNot to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by\nNo policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets\nNo reason for nobody's momma to cry\nSee, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter\nBut if I should die, I know all of my albums support her\nThis whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me\nOnly difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe\n'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'\nI'm just twenty-some-odd years\nI done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy\nI know she smiles on her boy\nI dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur\n'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war\nAnd just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more\n'Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne\nWhere angels soar with golden wings in Thugz Mansion\n[Chorus: J. Phoenix]\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, 'cause it's all good\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright\nNothing but peace, love, and street passion\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion18Embed"

    "lyrics": "Heaven Lyrics[Chorus: Jully Black & Saukrates]\nIf Heaven was a mile away\nWould I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?\nIf Heaven was a mile away\nOr save it all for you?\nIf Heaven was a mile away\nWould I fill the tank up, put gas\nAnd be out the front door in a (flash?)\nBefore reconsidering this hell with you\nIt ain't you, it's the things you do (do)\nIt's tearing my heart in two\nI would've fell with you, to Hell with you\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nIf Heaven was a mile away, and you could ride by the gates\nWould you try to run inside when it opens\nWould you try to die today?\nWould you pray louder, finally believe in His power?\nEven if you couldn't see Him, but you could feel Him\nWould you still doubt Him?\nHow would you start actin'?\nWould you try to put the keys down, thinkin' every drug sale that you make in the streets he can see now?\nWould a fiend even want to get high? Would he stop smokin'\nIf he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in?\nTo get away and escape from the craziness\nAnd I bet you there's a Heaven for a atheist\nIt's hard takin' this, racist planet\nWhere they take a younger brother in a hand-cuff\nEven if he innocent, \"Nigga, get on the car!\nPut your motherfuckin' hands up!\"\nThinkin' I'ma lose it, my mom's in chemo\nThree times a week yo, keep tryin', but people, it's hard\nAnd God, your young soldier's not sober but needs you\nThis world's my home, but world, I will leave you\n\n[Chorus: Jully Black & Saukrates]\nIf Heaven was a mile away\nWould I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?\nIf Heaven was a mile away\nOr save it all for you?\nIf Heaven was a mile away\nWould I fill the tank up, put gas\nAnd be out the front door in a (flash?)\nBefore reconsidering this hell with you\nIt ain't you, it's the things you do (do)\nIt's tearing my heart in two\nI would've fell with you, to Hell with you\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nNigga, what you think, I'ma stop building?\nI'ma stop feelin' like I'm Amistad's great-great-grandchildren?\nHow I'm not gonna want to make millions\nSince the quarter water days, in the hallways\nMakin' fake gold caps\nWith the Reese's Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day\nBut then my style has quite a while\nThat same type as Ill and Al Skratch\nGame time took 'em cats, never looked back\nCristal, blowin' dub sacks\nThat's when it all just hit me: you see, the broads and Bentleys\nIs nothin' unless my niggas spend it all with me\nI'd give it all away quickly\nJust to hear them all about some new kicks\nFree of any autographs, and not to be recognized, forgive me\nIt's becomin' unbearable, makin' hits is easy\nPut a famous bitch on a hook, there you go with a platinum CD\nI know you heard the noise, preachers touchin' on alter boys\nSodomizin', not realizin' God is watchin', before the Lord\nHow could they do the Devil's work?\nA man give another man head in Church\nHell, it hurts just to fathom the thought, wishin' that I fled the Earth\n\n[Chorus: Jully Black & Saukrates]\nIf Heaven was a mile away\nWould I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?\nIf Heaven was a mile away\nOr save it all for you?\nIf Heaven was a mile away\nWould I fill the tank up, put gas\nAnd be out the front door in a (flash?)\nBefore reconsidering this hell with you\nIt ain't you, it's the things you do (do)\nIt's tearing my heart in two\nI would've fell with you, to Hell with you\n[Outro: Nas]\nYou trapped in your own hell\nEvery day I wake up I'm blessed\nEvery day you wake up and breathe another breath, you blessed\nTo all them niggas runnin' around\nTalkin' about, \"I'm fucked up,\" \"I got to get on,\" \"I got to\u2026\"\n\"I'm in the grind,\" \"I'm fucked up\"\nYeah, we all in the grind\nBut look at the beautiful shit around you, it's a beautiful life\nAll my niggas locked up, keep ya heads up\nHeaven's just a mile away\nI'm talkin' Heaven on Earth, ain't got nothin' to do with money\nGot nothin' to do with nothin' material\nI'm talkin' about Heaven in your own heart\nIn your own world, baby, in your own existence\nTo my moms, look at me, baby\nI love you, girl, your boy's shinin', God's son...9Embed"

This is dumbness.\"\nGave me a crazy look and started swinging punches\nI ducked, couldn't believe it, the nigga so whipped\nHe got his gat and started squeezing, hit two policemen\nNeighbors dialed 911, they heard the thumping\nWounded cops kicked in the door and started dumping\nMe and his wife dip to the floor she smiled strange\nMy comrade was breathing no more, they killed James\n[Chorus]\nOh what a thrill\nInside a bitch feel\nGotta be strong to handle it, it's real\nPussy kills\nBacks shots keep a nigga open\nBitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking\nHuh, pussy kills\nOh what a thrill\nInside a bitch feel\nGotta be strong to handle it, it's real\nPussy kills\nBacks shots keep a nigga open\nBitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking\nHuh, pussy kills3Embed"
