Can I walk? Can I speak? Can I talk?\nCan I floss without you wanting me outlined in chalk?\nFamily gossiping, pocket watching him\nJealousy keeps blossoming, ain't let it box me in (King)\n'Cause you are not a king if you can't come out a thing\nThat you got yourself in, claiming nobody helping\nThe stupidest part of Africa produced Blacks that started algebra\nProof, facts, imagine if you knew that as a child, bruh\nNostalgia, how I rememb\u0435r things\nRemember crowns, remember, kings\nThey want your reign to cease (King)\nYou a king, you will be next to me, doing your own king shit, most definitely\nWe're so \"Say less when I speak\", y'all estrogen speak\nRespected by kings only, address me as chief\nInvested in things only a vet would\nOnly lames front on kings, that's expected from creeps\nYou mad at my niggas and any woman with interest in me\nYou could've made it (You was good), look at all the time wasted\nNow you gotta retract statements, shoulda stuck to the basics\nAll you had to do was tell the truth, like, fuck all the fake shit\nYou should want every brother to make it out\nBut brothers want trophies, they troll for clout\nRap is weird, weird flex, but okay\nYou ain't as ill as you think, you just okay\nYou got pressed in the hood, fix your jibs up, I'm on top\nStop fighting it, yo, stop with the over-righteousness\nIt's so lame, this media circus greedy and worthless\nMy life got 'em tight, why they wanna see me hurt up? (Why me?)\nReal kings everywhere, stand up\nIt come with the game (King\u2019s Disease)5Embed"

What's in a name? Suffering and pain\nGuts, blood, and tears, aim straight, game face, king's grace\nI came in this thinkin' you was gon' be this great thing\n'Cause I seen the greats do it with a great queen\nWhat these kings have in common? They had women who solid\nMalcolm needed Betty, I met some queens who wasn't ready\nThey envy the unhappiness of the greats\nThey don't have a fulfilled life yet, so they searchin' for ways\nTo feel what Sam felt, play the hand Marvin was dealt\nA Vandross, here's the cure, the antidote\nA thousand milligrams, make sure you don't overdose\nTurned to a businessman, used to serve 'em in the cold\nCold game, don't get exposed, stories get told\nYou glamorize the game, it ain't a glorious road\nRest in peace Kobe and Nip, that's off the rip\nKing shit, if it ain't about fam, it don't mean shit\nThe cure, love of the allure\nDonuts rotten, the phone tapped, tappin' in with Lord\n[Interlude]\nRoll the credits\n\n[Verse 2]\nCuban link QB chain belong in the MOMA\nSo boomerang, you salute my twenty-seven summers\nRolls-Royce Brigade just 'cause it go with the moment\nPac saw the chain, got his medallion, I won't\nInsinuate imitation 'cause I copied his stomach\nKings honor kings, straight from my pop to my son shit\nSteak tartare bloody, mercury levels from raw fish\nSushi for lunch, waiter at the table, the cork twist\nI'm studied like a book by many\nThey give me looks of envy, I took the Bentley\nWhite chick like Liz Taylor might get the Bentayga\nOn my Rick James behavior\nLife is school for the soul and I'm in life seven already\nLife's simple but heavy, incomprehensible shit\nEverything from sexy to deadly, I done been through that shit\nStill goin' deeper like I grew a new inch on my dick\nWe looked at robbin' as a way of resolving our problems\nMy moms cooked food, but some of my niggas was starving\nAnd whatever they was down to do, I was with 'em regardless\nTurns out I was hungry and was hittin' the hardest\nDecisions was sharper, my predictions was on it\nNo fortune teller, just going off regular signs\nNiggas often tell ya they moves\nWithout a word, just reading they mind\nWasn't needin' no nine\nCorner executive born in ghetto hell\nWhere metal yell especially over necklaces\nLife lessons is karma\nWhatever you dish out come back as blessings or to haunt ya\nCould miss your kids and hit your grandkids for your dishonor\nThat's generational curses, they said they want the old Nas back\nPlay the Clue tapes for old verses\nMessin' my homies' lives up, sayin' Nas'll rise 'em up\nLike they wasn't live enough, many lives I've touched\nCan I get a witness?\nCan I get a witness?\nI need a witness, drinkin' three at night on some Bridge shit\nWearin' shorts and Timbs, summer night on some Bridge shit\nParty with gangsters, gettin' right on some Bridge shit (Yeah)\nLike MC Shan and Marley, I be on some Bridge shit\n[Outro]\nYeah\nLike Jabari, I'm on some Bridge shit\nShooter live on\nKings live forever\nYeah\nWe go through a lot\nAnd nobody wanna hear about what we go through\nAnd that's cool too\nEvery man go through the same Mondays and Fridays\nSame sun, moon, and stars\nIt's just how you stand like a man10Embed"
