Let's go\n\n[Chorus 1: Puff Daddy and Nas]\nYou can hate me now, (Q.B.)\nBut I won't stop now (Real niggas)\n'Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts)\nYou can hate me now (C'mon)\nBut I won't stop now\n'Cause I can't stop now\nYou can hate me now\nYou can hate me now\n[Ad-lib over Chorus: Puff Daddy (Nas)]\nWell, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too\nIt's as simple as that\nDie motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!\nYou don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck\nGo down any way you want it to go down (do it now)\nWeak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now)\nFuck y'all!\n\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nDon't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy\nIce that I wear, flows that I try\nClose your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'\nBitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya\nMost critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner\nBest storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater\nModel dater, big threat to a lot of you haters\nCommentators ringside try watchin' my paper\nAlmost a decade, quite impressive\nMost of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for\nExpandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams\nBut it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens\nWant me off the scene fast, but good things last\nLike your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash\nFirst rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects\nBut you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest\n[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]\nMoney is power, motherfucker!\nI got millions of thugs on salary\n\n[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]\nYou can hate me now, (I won't stop)\nBut I won't stop now (I can't stop)\n'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)\nYou can hate me now (I hate you too)\nBut I won't stop now (You can hate me now)\n'Cause I can't stop now (Cmon)\nYou can hate me now (You can hate me now)\nYou can hate me now\n\n[Ad-Libs: Nas and Puff Daddy]\nDo it now! I told you, do it now!\nLet's go\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nYou wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do\nBut keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you\nI had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it\nNow y'all sayin': \"That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with.\"\nHate on me, I blew but I'm the same OG\nPeople warned me: \"When you're on top there's envy\"\nTook my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us\nSayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us\nMy bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?\nHere's my cars and my house, you can live in that too\nCriticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code\nGucci this, Fendi that \u2013 what you expect, hoe?\nNickname Esco, took this game to its threshold\nBest flow, I bet the whole U.S. know\nTry to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?\nThink we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?\n[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]\nYou think I'ma come this far\nAnd let you niggas stop me now?\nI hate you too!\n\n[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]\nYou can hate me now, (I won't stop)\nBut I won't stop now (I can't stop)\n'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)\nYou can hate me now (I hate you too)\nBut I won't stop now (You can hate me now)\n'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)\nYou can hate me now\nYou can hate me now\n\n[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]\nI like this, I like the way this feels\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nIt's a thin line between paper and hate\nFriends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights\nHell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come\nPredicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs\nSecond to none, wicked turn wives to widows\nShoot through satin pillows, the desolate one\nTook a little time to claim my spot\nJamming up the border to this game stop, and I side with the Lord\nRide for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors\nPlottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws\nTried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks\nInstead of me, ambulances were pickin' them up\nNiggas fear what they don't understand\nHate what they can't conquer, guess it's just inferior man\nBecame a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'\nI'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!\n\n[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]\nYou ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life\nAnd that's what you can't understand!\n\n[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]\nYou can hate me now, (I won't stop)\nBut I won't stop now (I can't stop)\n'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)\nYou can hate me now (I hate you too)\nBut I won't stop now (You can hate me now)\n'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)\nYou can hate me now\nYou can hate me now\n\n[Outro: Puff Daddy and Nas]\nYou can hate me now, (C'mon, niggas!)\nBut I won't stop now (Do it now!

    "lyrics": "Small World Lyrics[Produced by  Carlos \"6 July\" Broady & Nashiem Myrick]\n\n[Intro]\nSee no evil, fear no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil\nIf you don't bring that shit around you\nYou ain't got nothing to worry about (uh-huh)\nYeah (yeah, uh-huh)\nKnow what I'm saying?\nYo, yo yo yo\n\n[Verse 1]\nCarolyn from Maryland, she Lady Heroin\nShe elegant, her apparel in the M-Class caravan\nKeys of dope, loving cats to ski in her throat\nShe fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat\nHer ice fro, ass is curvy, 40 years old\nShe passing for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's\nMadison Ave., shopping when she not, copping bricks of that shit\nShe hopping on dicks, riding Pony's who trick\nAt my man's wake, she said the eulogy\nAfter that I usually bumped into her shopping for jewellery\nHer bodyguard screwing me, I gave her my math\nAin't nothing new to me, blowing backs out, six-pack Stout's\nWide fat mouth, the evil look with a bow-leg\nYo niggas said, \"Shorty's a pro, she blow heads\nShe push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her\"\nA code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy\nShe blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck\nShe knew about cats from way back, we smoke the haystack\nShe never coughed once, blunts was her hobby\nShe said I knew her man probably, no doubt, '96 he tried to rob me\nI jetted though, sometimes you never know\nHe snorted all her work, now she need me to do her dirty work\n[Chorus]\nIt's a small world (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nNigga you reap what you sow\nWhat goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know\nA very small world (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nWhere beef could never end\nAt the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again\nIt's a small world (\"It's a.. small world..\"), you get away with it now\nSoon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow\nYo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (\"It's a.. small world..\")\n\n[Verse 2]\nSnook from Red Hook was grimy, did 5 years, glad to be home\nFrom Attica, known for keeping chrome calibers\nSmooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it\n5 years planning to blow soon as he hit the bridicks\nHad a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low\nPlayed the crib for a month and deaded his P.O\nStarted robbing niggas \u2018til he caught a whole kilo\nHe had a bunch of starving niggas he owe, he never paid though\nGot large, sign on his door, \"Don't knock hard\"\nLaying with his bitch, 'niggas is rich' is what he told her\nPlayed the block, holding cracks inside the baby stroller\nHere come his crazy soldier, 6 shots it's over\nA year went past, Snook went flossing fast\nHis old man had crossed his ass for the laws of this fast cash\n[Chorus]\nIt's a small world (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nNigga you reap what you sow\nWhat goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know\nA very small world (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nWhere beef could never end\nAt the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again\nIt's a small world (\"It's a.. small world..\"), you get away with it now\nSoon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow\nYo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (\"It's a.. small world..\")\n\n[Verse 3]\nI seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why\nWe let the slugs fly, enter your brain through your skull\nAnother thug died, pitching your soul into that infinite\nBlack hole where many souls go cause of a .44 blast\nSnook was one of \u2018em, so many more\nEven that Fendi whore got niggas hit up, yeah let that Henny pour\nCarolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich\nHeard her bodyguard took Snook to God\nCarolyn when she needed him, he took the job\nHe was close to her ever since she took him inside\nWhen his moms died, dope fiend OD'd, '85\nHe went crazy, stuck up banks to stay alive\nHe was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried\nRobbed armored trucks, incidents where police died\nHe stayed in lower Eastside, peace God, he stared at me hard\nTwo of his mans with him, I got to hit 'em\nI'm reaching for my Roscoe, cocked it back on\nAnd get my blast on, at the gas station, bunch of Arabs racing\nOut the way as my Taurus spray\nJump in the whip, hit the highway\nYou know how I say, the game that I play\nIt's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies\nBut can't figure out whose who, keep it true\nShit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never\n'Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this cheddar\n[Chorus]\nIt's a small world (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nNigga you reap what you sow\nWhat goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know\nA very small world (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nWhere beef could never end\nAt the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again\nIt's a small world (\"It's a.. small world..\"), you get away with it now\nSoon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow\nYo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (\"It's a.. small world..\")\n\n[Outro]\nI'm going to see you again..\nUh-huh.. I'm going to see you again.. nigga..\nUh-huh.. going to see you again nigga.. yeah10Embed"

You know shit is rough after you slid\nYou in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid\nAin't nuttin' changed, still Party and Bullshit\nWe used to fuck R&B Bitches and see who rhyme sickest\nFor every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out\nMachine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts\nYou came to my hood, we was broke\nI wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?\nStill on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so\n'Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto\nBut fuck it black, you livin' your life, through your loved ones\nPeace to your daughter and your newborn son\nIt used to be fun, makin' records to see your response\nBut, now competition is none, now that you're gone\nAnd these niggas is wrong, using your name in vain\nAnd they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that\nIt's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you\nJoke with you, happy we on top, the most official\nAin't too many real ones out there, I feel some but doubt they're\nCapable to take it where you took it to\nI missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake\n'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way\nI woulda stayed so long with so much to say\nI had to put it in writin' to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin'\nTellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side\nBut I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by\nYou can't kill nothin' that's Ready to Die\nYou was like God to us in the form of Allah\n[Kenny Loggins sample]\nStill somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?\n\n[Chorus]\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\n\n[Verse 2]\n(Thug Life never die..)\nDear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop\nAnd use teeth to bite off beer tops and Pour Out a Lil' Liquor\nYou was more than just the wildest nigga\n2Pacalypse, I understand your style, nigga\nIt's goin on the third year, since you've been gone\nOn the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on\nThe industry be talkin', offendin' me often\nThey don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin\nI can relate, shootouts and court dates\nAll Eyez on You, niggas in your face invadin' your space\nYou asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?\nHow long would I ride before I fold up?\nHow did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?\nYou predicted it in every line, all in your flow\nThere could Never Be Peace I have to quote\nCan't believe I heard my name on \"the realest shit you ever wrote\"\nWe had words 'cause the best supposed to clash at the top\nBut kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped\nIn NYC, at MTV, people watched\nWe was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep\nThink about how us real niggas would be\nIf we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?\nYou was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified\nLike the son of God, when Lucifer lied\nAnd make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?\nBut Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link\nWill there ever be another MC as nice?\nWill you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?\n[Kenny Loggins sample]\nStill somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?\n\n[Chorus]\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?\nDid Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?\nWhat has Al Green seen, that made him religious?\nWas it the drugs, put an end to the music business?\nIf so, should I put out the indo right now and write down\nA plan and pursue my dream, turn my life around\n'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream\nI'll need a extra Uzi ridin' through my own hood in Queens\nIt be the ones you always knew, that want it on\nTellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on\nThought we walked a million miles it was just twenty\nNot used to walkin' in the path of legit money\nI thought I made it but we only took baby steps\nUp the success ladder, where they pay me checks\nTo my clicks when I got it I said \"Baby bless\"\nThat was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess\nWe in the 90's and finally it's lookin' good\nHip-Hop took it to billions, I knew we would\nA lot of ups and downs in the game\nCould lose or gain a couple pounds tryin' to maintain\nOne day you here, the next you not; when you around niggas, check 'em out\nSome is 'bout it, most individuals plots\nAnd run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves\nWhile others have no cares and stay in jail\nMore than 50% of us endin' up with holes through the chest\nThrough the head, through the gut it shows\nThe future for us young shooters and old killers\nWho become rich as dope dealers?\nNothin' left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments\nThug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap\nWe want the fast way out of this trap\nWhether it be 9 to 5 or slangin' crack\nTo my deceased Gods wishin' I could bring you back\nBut life is a dream and y'all taught me that\n[Kenny Loggins sample]\n.. always survive.. but why?\n\n[Outro]\nAlways survive, always\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive (no matter what)\nStill, we, will survive (no matter what)\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my niggas just stay alive6Embed"

I'm the seller of minutes\nI give you every second low-priced, if I sold lies; the truth is\nTime waits for none of you, in fact\nHe can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you\nSmall visions of better life if cheddar was right\nLurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time\nTrapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin' but takin'\nHeaded for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin'\nJudges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin' where the kids play\nRichochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes\nIn bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A\nAround the way where we from\nHope the future reduce the rate of those buried young\nLife is every man's kingdom, a dyin' man's past\nAnd a newborn's, first time to be here at last\nAnd shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain\nHustlin' harder than the generations here before he came\nGoin' through the same bullshit as our fathers\nReadin' history, but who's the authors?\nFor some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder\nBut never lose faith; through the years just get smarter\nGhetto prisoners.. ghetto prisoners..\n\n[Chorus]\nGhetto prisoners rise rise rise\nGhetto prisoners rise rise rise\nGhetto prisoners rise rise rise\nGhetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise\nGhetto prisoners rise rise rise\nGhetto prisoners rise rise rise\nGhetto prisoners rise rise rise\nGhetto prisoners..2Embed"

Can't take it with you under this earth\nRich men died and tried, but none of it worked\nThey just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid\nBefore my number's called, history's made\nSome'll fall, but I rise, thug or die\nMaking choices that determine my future under the sky\nTo rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why\nIt's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?\nMuch success to you, even if you wish me the opposite\nSooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is\n[Chorus]\nNas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel\nMy poetry's deep, I never fell\nNas is like; half-man, half-amazing (C'mon)\nNo doubt\nNas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel\nMy poetry's deep, I never fell\nNas is like; half-man, half-amazing\nNo doubt (Uh)\n\n[Verse 3]\n(Nas is like) Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet\nI'm like beef, busting heat through your windows\nI'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather\nLike Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers\nI'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for\nAlways got you, I\u2019m like Pac, dude you would cry for\nI'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money\nCorporate accounts from a rich company\nI'm like ecstasy for ladies\nI'm like all races combined in one man, like the '99 Summer Jam\nBulletproof Hummer man\nI'm like being locked down around new faces and none of 'em fam\nI'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand\nI'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet\nLive it and I write down and I watch it blow up\nY'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in ya system every night, now\n[Chorus]\nNas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel\nMy poetry's deep, I never fell\nNas is like; half-man, half-amazing\nNo doubt\nNas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel\nMy poetry's deep, I never fell\nNas is like; half-man, half-amazing\nNo doubt (Uh); Nas is like92Embed"

I did that\nPut it way up where her ribs at, her future kids at\nYou held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats\nYou precious, more precious than lost treasure\nMatter of fact I'm kinda hoping we can stay together, word\n[Chorus]\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nGirl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\n\n[Verse 2]\nI see you dressed up in white face covered in veil\nDo I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwing rice\nAnd it's the day that your father give you away\nTo a real man that gently put the ring on your hand\nDo we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to\nNow, look me in my eyes and say I do\nDriving off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates\nWe can spend our honeymoon in the States\nYou can throw your friend the bouquet\nSomething in the back of my head say\nWhy us two? Maybe 'cause I love you\nHug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you\nAs long as we together it's heaven for me to please you\nWon't stop 'til I tell you me to, beautiful\nDeeper and harder love laying new with you\nRunning my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by\nWhile I'm with you and I won't even care, word\n\n[Chorus]\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nGirl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\n[Verse 3]\nShe been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's\nColombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas\nThug ones to those soft as baby shit\nShe been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips\n'Til one day she decided to flip\nIt was nutting I can do about it, like she the boss and shit\nStarted talking this divorcing shit\nI gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake\nHalf my car, half my kids? Can't get that\nTried to swing on the God, had to dip that\nYo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that\nAll she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass\nHad to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look\nWith a fine-ass body and a damn good cook\nFor some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too\nYou my queen, God bless you\n\n[Chorus]\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nGirl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nGirl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G3Embed"

    "lyrics": "Undying Love Lyrics[Produced by L.E.S]\n\n[Verse 1]\nUh...\nPacino life, G a roll, casino dice\nAt The Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights\nGamblers, puffin' cigars, couples and stars\nFlashin' cameras, dealers, shufflin' cards\nSpent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd\n'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob\nI never hang out, when we do we bust the .45\n'Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride\nFlyin', duckin', our bitches in the club cluckin'\nTellin' my wife who I was dancin' with like I was fuckin'\nFlew back, Monday evenin'\nFrom Nevada where the sun was beamin'\nTo the concrete jungle of cement\nLimousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin'\nTold my dogs \"Peace\", kept it movin', I was beat when\nGot to my crib, where the hell my keys went?\nRingin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure\nDropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door\nSlow music, H-Town, no, that's down low\nMy baby's drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around, yo\nTo the back, she must be inside and can't hear\nProbably upstairs, in the mirror, doin' her hair\nI walked in through the back door entrance\nShocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense\nChased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses\nAnd lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas\nA pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands\nSomethin' swingin' on the ceiling fan, I stopped it\nSwingin' slower and slower\nOn the last swing, I saw it was a G-string and heard laughter\nThought about my nine-side Glock\nBut somethin' made me disregard it\nStarted my way up to where the noise and music was at\nFroze, I couldn't react\nBedroom door opened a crack\nSeen wifey layin' with some nigga mumblin' shit\nHe had one hand on her ass, and she was rubbin' his dick\nToastin' wine glasses, cherry scented candles was lit\nCouldn't handle the shit\nSearchin' for words \u2014 I found none\nWithout a sound, I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun\nNow I'm out buggin', whylin', what I'm gon' do?\nCall my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through\n[Chorus x2]\nI thought you loved me\nI thought you cared for me\nI thought you needed me\nDid you believe in me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nGot up with Horse, showed a look on my face, was mad lost\nI ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off\n\"Son, you home early \u2014 they wiped you out that quick?\"\nI said, \"Nah,\" showed him the plastic with nine in the clip\nHopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play\nTo the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway\nI said, \"Bet you'll never guess in a million years\nWhat I just saw happenin' \u2014 and probably still is\nSnuck in my crib, some nigga fuckin' my wiz\nI saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid\nI'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me\"\nJust when I thought I found love, she shitted on me\nShopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement\n20G's on a ring I would've hit her today with\nMy surprise couldn't match the one she had for me\nWe pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly\nParked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us\nRan to the side of my house, cocked the heater\nWalked to the front, when I talked he had jumped\nBitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot\nShot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in\nGrabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend\nOne between the eye, she's died, by mistake\nMust've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face\nHeard somebody knock \u2014 Horse helped me hide the bodies\nHeard si-rens, I guess we goin' out like kamikaze\nWe surrounded, red lights flashin', who's inside?\nCame out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin' suicide\nHorse asked me for the MAC, he gave me dap, one love\nCocked the strap, then he ran out the back\nMad shots, couldn't tell what was goin' on\nSat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms\nPulled her ring out my pocket I was savin'\nPut it on her ring finger, cocked the Glock and started prayin'\nTo Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial\nThrough you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin'\nI never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed\nThis'd be my fate, such a grotesque murder scene\nOn that note, same time, the cops busted in\nKissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said \"Amen\"\nPut the nine to my head, pulled the hammer\nHeld her close, squeeze the toast\nSaid to her, \"Now unto God, we elope... we elope\"\n[Outro: Cop]\nStupid fucking niggers19Embed"
