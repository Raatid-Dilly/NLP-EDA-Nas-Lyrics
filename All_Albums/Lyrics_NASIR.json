Be solid, your foes hold you in ill regard\nThis ain't knowledge, this is not intense\nFor honored men, women too\nUs who can see the same thing, but have a different view (Let's go)\nAll of a sudden, frontin' niggas knew you from your past\nGot all kinds of guys sayin' we go way back\nAnd who y'all comparin' me to is nonsense\nShow gratitude in the presence of dominance\n[Chorus: 070 Shake & Nas]\nI think they scared of us, yeah\nI think they scared of us\nI think they scared of us, yeah\nI think they scared\nTo Catholics\u2026\n\n[Verse 2: Nas & Puff Daddy]\nTo Catholics, Moors and Masons (Motherfuckers!)\nJohn Hanson was not the first black pres to make it\nAbe Lincoln did not free the enslaved\nProgress was made 'cause we forced the proclamation\n(Fuck your proclamation!)\nSWAT was created to stop the Panthers\nGlocks were created for murder enhancement\nFor hunting men, circumstances\nEdgar Hoover was black\nWillie Lynch is a myth, Colombians created crack\nThe government made stacks (Welcome to America, niggas!)\nReagan had Alzheimer's, that's true\nFox News was started by a black dude, also true (Fuck you too!)\nConvinced my experiences were meant to be\nHelps me navigate as they validate they treachery\nFelt established, fake as he smile, handshake questionable\n\"Am I good?\" he ask, thinkin', \"But is he testin' you?\"\n(Is he testin' you?) In my hood, fear does a few things\nMake you pussy, make you a snitch\nMake irrational moves or even turn you to food\n[Chorus: 070 Shake & Puff Daddy]\nI think they're scared of us, yeah\nI think they're scared of us\nI think they're scared of us, yeah\nI think they scared\nI think they scared of us, yeah\nI think they scared of us\nSee, we don't care about what you think about us\nI think they scared of us, yeah\nWhat you say about us\nI think they scared\nYou bitch ass, yeah\n[Outro: Puff Daddy]\nAyo, that's why they be killing us and shooting us\nThat's why they feel uncomfortable around us\n'Cause of our greatness\nYou're lucky God made us compassionate\nAnd forgiving\nPssh, man, they scared of us, Nas\nWe see that bitch in your eyes30Embed"

She still get slayed (bonjour)\nThat's ill behavior, want the whip matted\nWant her ass the fattest, beat it: Thriller jacket\nA street metaphor: if your dog piss on the floor\nPut his nose in it, check these niggas from the door\n\n[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams]\nOooh oooh la la, oui-oui amour\nPlenty of kisses, plein de bisous\nGood day and best wishes\nComment allez-vous?\nBonjour\n[Verse 2: Nas & The World Famous Tony Williams]\nEat at selective kitchens, speak on our next intentions\nOver-creamy Polenta, it come chef recommended (bonjour)\nCome through the side entrance; I arrived, bitches\nCrackheads still owe me from '89 fixes (bonjour)\nHavin' drinks in Vegas, my business\nShe didn't see me comin', now she's an eyewitness\nLaissez le bon temps rouler\nSay ahh so the kids could play\n\n[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams]\nOooh oooh la la, oui-oui amour\nPlenty of kisses, plein de bisous\nGood day and best wishes\nComment allez-vous?\nBonjour\n\n[Verse 3: Nas & The World Famous Tony Williams]\nVacation, twisted, whatever happened, missed it\nVacations I didn't like, put myself through a guilt trip (bonjour)\nAll these beautiful places, but the cities be poor\nYou wealthy when your kid's upbringin' better than yours\nAll this money we gettin' could be gone in a minute\nIf we don't invest it\u2014we long-term affected\nWatch who you gettin' pregnant, that's long-term stressin'\nI got a mil for every bump on your face, that's what I call a blessin'\nFlexin'\n[Verse 4: The World Famous Tony Williams]\nMy head looks straight up\nAnd I'm wonderin', \"What did I do?\" (bonjour)\nShe looked at me like, \"Damn, did I surprise you?\"\nSure enough, as the sky's blue, she turned back around\nAnd walked back down the avenue (bonjour)\nShe's waitin' for the right cue (bonjour)\nI'm waitin' for the right clue (bonjour)\n\n[Outro: The World Famous Tony Williams]\n(Oooh oooh la la, oui-oui amour)\nShe be leavin', still I smell of eau de parfum\nShe can't run 'cause I got Cinderella's right shoe\nIn that white gown that I be seein' right through\nCrowd obscurin' my view\nThere's nothin' left to argue (bonjour)\nAt least there's not from my view (bonjour)18Embed"
