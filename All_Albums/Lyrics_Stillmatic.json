What?)\nFuck Jay-Z\nYou been on my dick, nigga\nYou love my style, nigga (Uh, uh, uh, uh)\nFuck Jay-Z\n[Chorus]\n(I) Fuck with your soul like ether\n(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you\n(Not) God's Son across the belly\n(Lose) I'll prove you lost already (Uh)\n\n[Verse 1]\nBrace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'\nIt's like a AIDS test, what's the results?\nNot positive, who's the best, Pac, Nas and B.I.G.?\nAin't no best, east, west, north, south, flossed out\nGreetings, I embrace y'all with napalm\nBlows up, no guts left, chest, face gone\nHow could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage (Uh)\nBurner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne\nI got this locked since '91 (Uh), I am the truest\nName a rapper that I ain't influenced\nGave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas\nWith Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music, check it\n\n[Chorus]\n(I) Fuck with your soul like ether\n(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you\n(Not) God's Son across the belly (Haha)\n(Lose) I'll prove you lost already (Uh)\n[Interlude]\nAyo, pass me the weed (Tsk, there you go)\nPut my ashes out on these niggas, man (Ain't no doubt)\nAyo, you faggots, y'all kneel and kiss the motherfuckin' ring\n[Chorus]\n(I) Fuck with your soul like ether\n(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you\n(Not) God's Son across the belly\n(Lose) I'll prove you lost already\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten\nLuck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten\nY'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (Uh)\nTalk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face\nY'all some well-wishin' (Bitch niggas), friendly-actin', envy-hidin' snakes\nWith your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?\nWhen these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep\nThat this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef (What?)\nStarted cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo\nTo explode it on a camel (Haha) and his soldiers I can handle\nThis for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid\nWhen KRS already made a album called Blueprint (Dick)\nFirst Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say\nThat you better than B.I.G., dick-suckin' lips (Ha)\nWhy don't you let the late, great veteran live?\n[Interlude]\nI will\nNot lose (God's son across the belly, I'll prove you lost already), uh\nThe king is back\nWhere my crown at? (Ill Will)\nIll Will, rest in peace, let's do it, niggas\n\n[Chorus]\n(I) Fuck with your soul like ether\n(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you\n(Not) God's Son across the belly\n(Lose) I'll prove you lost already\n[Verse 3]\nY'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches\nWhat's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches\nMy child, I've watched you grow up to be famous\nAnd now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it\nYou seem to be only concerned with dissin' women\nWere you abused as a child? Scared to smile, they called you ugly?\nWell, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me\nOr make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly\nIn '88 you was gettin' chased through your building\nCallin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers\nAll I did was give you a style for you to run with\nSmilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God\nWearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars\nNo jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case\nJust Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase\nYou a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan\nI'll still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class?\nYou Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?\nAsk me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?\nNah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn, though\nThat ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow (Burn slow)\nIs he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?\nOh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy (Ill)\nRockefeller died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter\nAnd that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?\nPut it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas\nAnd now y'all tryna take my spot, fellas?\nFeel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas\nIn a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas\nFoxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss\nWhat you think, you gettin' girls now 'cause of your looks? (Girls, girls, girls, haha)\nNegro, please, ha, you no-mustache-havin'\nWith whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans, you wack\nAnd your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame\nYou ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane, to Irv, to B.I.G\nAnd Eminem murdered you on your own shit\nYou a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention\nQueens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons, ha\nR-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick\nJ.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick\nYour whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick\nShawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn, you on Jaz dick\nSo little Shawny's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick\nHow much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips? (Nigga)\nWanted to be on every last one of my classics\nYou pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss170Embed"

Lyrics[Produced by Megahertz]\n\n[Intro: Alabama 3 & Nas]\nWoke up this mornin' (Yeah)\nYou got yourself a gun (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nGot yourself a gun\n\n[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]\nYo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines, so\nI got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun\nAnd when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so\nYou tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun\nYou ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nMy first album had no famous guest appearances\nThe outcome, I'm crowned the best lyricist\nMany years on this professional level\nWhy would you question who's better? The world is still mine\nTattoo's real, with \"God's Son\" across the belly, the boss of rap\nYou saw me in Belly with thoughts like that\nTo take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie\nMe and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle\nYou lames could huddle, your team's shook\nY'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field\nThrowin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel\nBut the QB don't stand for no quarterback\nEvery word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft\nAnd I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in\nIt's for the hood by the corner store\nMany try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody\n\n[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]\nI got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun\nAnd when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so\nYou tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun\nYou ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun, yo\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nI'm the N, the A to the S-I-R\nAnd if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar\nYou know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed, hair parted with a\nBarber's preciseness, Bravehearted for life, it's\nReturn of the golden child, son of a blues player\nSo who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior\nPuffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too\nPapi chu's, tore up, wake up in a hospital\nThrow up? Never, 'member I do this through righteous steps\nYou Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death\nY'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos\nCall me God's Son with my pants low\nI don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo\nThis is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow\nWhat could beat that? Not a soul reppin'\nHit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo\n\n[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]\nI got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun\nAnd when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so\nYou tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun\nYou ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nIt's the return of the prince, the boss\nThis is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft\nSip Cris', get chips, wrist glist', I floss\nStick shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche\nWith the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source\nThey don't know about the blocks I'm on\nAnd everybody wanna know where the kid go\nWhere he rest at, where he shop at and dress at\nKnow he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?\nDoes he really know how ill that he is?\nGot all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels\nHop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that\nIt's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains\nLook at my tennis shoes, I iced that\nWho am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper\nAutomatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter\nKeepin' it gangsta with ya (Uh)\n\n[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]\nI got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun\nAnd when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so\nYou tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun\nYou ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun\n\n[Outro: Nas & Alabama 3]\nGot yourself a gun (Uh)\nI got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun\nAnd when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so\nYou tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun\nYou ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun27Embed"

This hood politics\nAcknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages\nSeeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us\nPolice watch us, roll up and try knockin' us\nOne knee, I ducked, could it be my time is up?\nBut my luck, I got up, the cop shot again\nBus stop glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken\nRicochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in\nBlackin' out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit\nThis is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it\n'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown\nHoodrats, don't abortion your womb\nWe need more warriors soon, sent from the stars, sun and the moon\nIn this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers\nStick-up kids with no conscience leavin' victims with doctors\nIf you really think you ready to die with nines out\nThis is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now\n[Chorus]\nYo, all I need is one mic\nAll I need is one mic (That's all I need)\nAll I need is one mic (All I need, niggas)\nAll I need is one mic (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll I need is one blunt, one page and one pen\nOne prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin\nMatter fact, maybe more than one\nLook back at all the hatred against me, fuck all of them\nJesus died at age thirty-three, there's thirty-three shots\nFrom twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two\nWhich means one of my guns was holdin' seventeen\nTwenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you\nEverybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral\nNever gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent\nNothin' is fair, niggas roll up shootin' from wheelchairs\nMy heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air\nI let this shit slide for too many years, too many times\nNow I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, two mini nines\nIf y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis\nDo more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty\nThere's nothin' in our way, they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush\nLead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut\nThat we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down\n'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now\n[Chorus]\nAll I need is one mic (That's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)\nAll I need is one mic (There's nothin' else in the world)\nAll I need is one mic (That's all a nigga need to do his thing, you know?)\nAll I need is one mic (This is all I need)\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man\nWhat I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand\nDon't wanna see me on top, too egotistical\nTalkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do\nWonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you\nOnly if they know what your weakness is, I have none\nToo late to grab guns, I'm blastin' 'cause I'm a cool nigga\nThought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas\nWhat you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'\nWar gets deep, some beef is everlastin'\nComplete with thick scars\nBrothers knifin' each other up in prison yards\nDrama, where does it start?\nYou know the block was ill as a youngster\nEvery night it was like a cop'll get killed, body found in a dumpster\nFor real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwin' dirt on my name\nJealous 'cause fiends got they work and complained\nBitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished\nShoulda knew she wasn't true, she came to me when her man caught a sentence\nDiamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes\nMovin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight\nSwellin' my melon 'cause none of these niggas real\nHeard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?\nThis is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found\nYou need some soul-searchin', the time is now\n[Chorus]\nAll I need is one mic (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nAll I need is one mic (All I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)\nAll I need is one mic (Fuck the cars, the jewelry)\nAll I need is one mic (To spread my voice to the whole world, baby)55Embed"

Tyrone, 'member no cursin' front of Ms. Vercey\nBig Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters\nMy building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean\nI knew all that I'd seen had meant somethin'\nLearned early to fear none, little Nas was huntin'\nLivin' carefree laughin', got jokes on the daily\nY'all actin' like some old folks, y'all don't hear me\nYo, I'm in my second childhood\n[Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier]\nWhen I flow for the street, who else could it be?\nN-A-S, Nas\nResurrect through the birth of my seed, Queensbridge\nMake everything right, get yours, nigga\nWhen I flow for the street, who else could it be?\nN-A-S, Nas\nResurrect through the birth of my seed, Queensbridge\nMake everything right, get yours\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, dude is 31, livin' in his mom's crib\nEx-convict, was paroled there after his long bid\nCornrows in his hair, still slingin', got a crew\nThey break his mom's furniture, watchin' Comicview\nGot babies by different ladies, high, smokin' L's\nIn the same spot he stood since '85, well\nWhen his stash slow, he be crazy\nSay he by his moms, hit her on her payday\nJunior high school dropout, teachers never cared\nThey was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds\nSo he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years\nSittin' on different benches like it's musical chairs\nAll his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night\nWith young dudes, it's them he wanna be like\nIt's sad but it's fun to him, right? He never grew up\n31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood\n[Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier]\nWhen I flow for the street, who else could it be?\nN-A-S, Nas\nResurrect through the birth of my seed, Queensbridge\nMake everything right, get yours, nigga\nWhen I flow for the street, who else could it be?\nN-A-S, Nas\nResurrect through the birth of my seed, Queensbridge\nMake everything right, get yours\n\n[Verse 3]\nBaby girl, she's always talkin', name droppin', hangin' late\nDrinkin', smokin', hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin'\nE poppin', ecstasy takin', won't finish her education\nBest friend she keeps changin', stuck with limitations\nLustin' men, many hotels, Fendi, Chanel\nWith nothin' in her bank account frontin' she do well\nHer kid suffers, he don't get that love he deserve\nHe the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse\nNo job, never stay workin', mad purty\nShorty, they call her the brain surgeon\nTime flyin', she the same person\nNever matures, all her friends married, doin' well\nShe's in the streets yakkety yakkin' like she was twelve\nHoney is twenty-seven, argues fights\nSelfish in her own right for life\nGuess she's in her second childhood\n[Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier]\nWhen I flow for the street, who else could it be?\nN-A-S, Nas\nResurrect through the birth of my seed, Queensbridge\nMake everything right, get yours, nigga\nWhen I flow for the street, who else could it be?\nN-A-S, Nas\nResurrect through the birth of my seed, Queensbridge\nMake everything right, get yours\nWho else could it be?\nN-A-S, Nas20Embed"

We must stop the killing\nTell me why we die, we all God's children\n[Chorus: Nas and Amerie]\nAll this hate can't last forever (Uh, come on)\nIt's time that we stand together (Yeah, for the world)\nEverybody wants to rule the world (What? What? What? What? What? Come on)\nWorld (Peace)\nWorld (Peace)\nWorld (Peace)\nWorld\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nYo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it\nThat's they corner, from New York to California\nGot blocks locked down\nLike, \"Dog you safe whenever you with me, see, this is my town\"\nSo the youngsters grows in ghettos, goes to prison\nAt a early age already know what's against him\nSo in order for him to survive\nOne day he must open up his eyes to the setbacks and rise\n'Cause everybody wants a shot\nIn this land of opportunity, look at what this country's got\nThere shouldn't be nobody homeless\nHow can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet?\nThe Earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone\nTo all colors and creeds is to whom it belongs\nI want land, mansions, banks, and gold\nThe diamonds in Africa, oil in my control\nThe world's natural resources, all its residuals\nBut then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles\nAnd I become the most wanted\nBut is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service?\nI guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels\nSo move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo\n[Chorus: Nas and Amerie]\nAll this hate can't last forever (Uh, come on)\nIt's time that we stand together (Yeah, for the world)\nEverybody wants to rule the world (What? What? What? What? What? Come on)\nWorld (Peace)\nWorld (Peace)\nWorld (Peace)\nWorld\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nY'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time\nNo other compares to what Nas write down\nTell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours\nYou could get what you love, be a chain in cause\nYou alive right now\nThere's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a highlight now\nIt's whatever man think of manifest to the real\nThe plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals\nAll this hate can't forever last\nAll my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed\nYou just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again\nHoping I reach the world leaders and win\nAin't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical\nWe used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical\nIn hip-hop, the weapons are lyrical\nTo be the best, you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual\nTop of the world for the kid, none less\nPoppin' any rapper's head off his shoulders, no contest\nI know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me\nYou scared of a mirror, my theory is that knowledge is power\nTo every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now\n[Outro: Nas and Amerie]\nAll this hate can't last forever\nIt's time that we stand together\nEverybody wants to rule the world\nWorld\n\n[Outro: Skit]\nYo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm saying?\nNiggas ain't forget nothing, man\nMen, women and children killed by the police and shit\nNiggas ain't gon' forget that, man, you know what I mean?\nYo, what this war just show me is, like\nWhatever you want out of life, whatever you feel is rightfully yours\nGo out and take it, even if that means blood and death\nYou know, that's what I was raised up on, that's what this country's about\nThis is\u2014 This is what my country is\nAnd my country's a motherfucker11Embed"

things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\nMy country shitted on me (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nAyo, it's packed on this Rikers bus\nThe tightest cuffs is holdin' me shackled\nThe life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso\nOn the streets I was invincible\nCowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew\nWhat my pistol would do, a fuckin' killer\nMother's a dope fiend embarrassin' me\nAll in front of my friends in the street, smile with no teeth\nI never knew daddy, heard he had a '72 caddy\nDied in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably three\nWhy didn't my folks just die in this society\nWhy wasn't I a child of a doctor who left stocks for me?\nTwo little brothers, two sisters, them shorties gots to eat\nMother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me\nI'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father\nWhether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers\nBlurry visions of dad holdin' me high\nIt comes to me slowly, the words he would cry\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nMy country shitted on me (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\nMy country shitted on me (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\n[Verse 2: Millennium Thug]\nIt is I that step up, me that don't give a fuck\nYou that foe, then it's all over soldier\nHummers and Ranges through the desert, fuck a twenty-inch\nLong as we got gas and we got water\nTroopers lookin' for manslaughter, I gotta get back\nFor what they owe, shoot 'em in the back for the get back\nLead through shit bag, hogtie, gag\nForget the life had, now we all rebels\nEverything burnt down includin' the ghetto\nWe can see for miles, the land, it's major rubble\nAnd debris from the Earth as we knew crumble\nYo, you could see the sea and the stars look closer to me\nI'm a mad man, this is a real life movie, Mad Max\nSKs, AKs max\nABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap\nMy mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back, but, yo\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nMy country shitted on me (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\nMy country shitted on me (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\n[Verse 3: Nas & Millennium Thug]\nYo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls\nI got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God\nBrothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape\nSome brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape\nHow is the war, and, yo, I'm wishin' I was in your shoes\nHoldin' machine guns, clean fun\nShootin' dudes with fatigues on\nAnywhere is better than this\nIt's America's plan, every color of man inherits the shit\nYo, I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares\nI know the warden is readin' the scribe, but, yo, I swear\nIt's a billion dollar business, courts, lawyers and jails\nWe all slaves in the system, I'm 'bout to rebel\n\n[Verse 4: Millennium Thug]\nThere's not a bitch in sight or a block bench\nAll-black gate, all-gray fence\nLook who fucked it all up, Mr. President\nI remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent\nNow it's state of the art\nI just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart\nWhat a bloody mess, a slug fest\nI just buried eight of mine\nAt night I hear grown men cryin'\nYou know I'm spittin' mine, I ain't goin' out here\nWe gotta win, every time I hear the wind I think a slug went in\nI'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head\nCatchin' my breath, watchin' my back\nSmokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass\nI don't know what they broadcast, the newsflash is fake\nEvery day I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape\nAnd if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nMy country shitted on me (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\nMy country shitted on me (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen ('Cause the things we seen)\n\n[Outro: Nas]\nThis goes out to Che Guevara\nA revolutionary destroyed by his country\nJust trying to fight for what's real\nThis goes out to my nigga Malcolm El-Hajj Malik Shabazz\nJust tryna to fight for what's real\nThis goes out to Martin\nAll about peace and destroyed by his own country\nThis goes out to everybody in the whole world\nJust trying to fight for what's real\nTo Patrice Lumumba\nJust trying to fight for what's real and destroyed by his own people\nThis goes out to my hood niggas\nComing up every day just trying to survive\nThe only way we know how\nBut see we know too much now, and we seen too much now\nSo ain't nothing gon' to stop us now\nTo my country\nMy country\nMy country\nMy country\nMy country\nYeah, my country8Embed"

    "lyrics": "Every Ghetto Lyrics[Verse 1: Nas]\nUh, yeah, uh\nBlessings of life to the children, they say life is like five days\nWords of a old man with silver hair, in his wheelchair\nHis eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me\nSaid evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me\nIt occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer\nI'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have to kill ya\n'Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water\nIshmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order\nShit is plastic material, havin' no life\nI crash whips and leave it no matter the price\nAs long as I survive, cop a new five\nCircle the block where the beef's at\nAnd park in front of my enemy's eyes\nThey see that it's war, we life stealers, hollow-tip lead busters\nThere's no Heaven or Hell, dead is dead, fuckers\nAnd your soul is with God, your mind keeps lurkin' the earth\nWatchin' your own murder reoccur\n[Chorus: Blitz]\nFor every struggle, every strip, and every ghetto\nFor every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal\nFor every child that's born, and every nigga gone\nAnd for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning\nFor every struggle, every strip, and every ghetto\nFor every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal\nFor every child that's born, and every nigga gone\nAnd for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning\n\n[Verse 2: Blitz]\nIt's Blitz, nigga, the streets glory, many die for me\nGot knocked, refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me\nBasically I'm just reality, loaded with foul stories of lust\nGreed and contempt, no street is exempt\nExtended clip shots, hoods barricaded for six blocks\nI sip shots, watchin' 'em hustlers pitch rocks\nOil paintin' pictures of my pain, illustrate the city in vain\nFallin' deep into the pits of the game\nThis is for the sickest state of mind, in these fatal times\nVest crimes, nickel-plated nines and niggas for the dime\nHear the sounds of them babies cry, still I'm sayin' why do we reside\nIn the ghetto with a million ways to die?\nStayin' high to relieve the pain, breathin' in the game\nExhalin' guilt, sin and shame, misery and strain\nWhat the fuck will tomorrow bring, luck or anthrax?\nI stand back, hopin' I'll make it through tomorrow\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nMy skin is a art gallery, right, with paintings of crucifixes\nHopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business\nWas once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders\nBut since I tasted paper it started losin' the friendships\nWatchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor\nHow could I tease them with Benzes and feel no remorse?\nDrivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'\nRed stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones\nFuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex\nAnd spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des?\nGot guns when I'm with my daughter\nHate to bring a violent aura in her presence\nShe know what daddy taught her, it's lessons\nBlack princess, it's a ugly world\nI put my life up for yours, see I love that girl\nCould you believe even my shadow's jealous?\nMy skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones\nMy brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs\nThough my songs come from the Father\nI'm lonely, hold me, it's gettin' darker\n\n[Chorus: Blitz]\nFor every struggle, every strip, and every ghetto\nFor every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal\nFor every child that's born, and every nigga gone\nAnd for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning\nFor every struggle, every strip, and every ghetto\nFor every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal\nFor every child that's born, and every nigga gone\nAnd for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning5Embed"
