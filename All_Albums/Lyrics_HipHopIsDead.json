New York City...\nTryna to see where I'ma go tonight...\nThe most famous town in the whole fuckin' world...\nThe other night, nigga was at Lotus...\nI hit P and them\nI was Dom P'ed up in there, you know...\nBut I found this new spot we went to the other night, yo\nCheck it out, check it out how it went\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt was just cool like, smooth night with my jewels bright\nGoons left, goons right, coupe with blue lights\nBad girls in black pearls, gave us cat calls\nTook 'em back to the crib to break they ass off\nIn the loft, mixing hash and dro\nHoney spreaded that asshole like a wide mouth bass\nSippin' wine out the glass, Teddy Pendergrass blast\nWhen the phone ring, the house lights flash\nTurned down the sound, let's get down to business\nShit about to go down with some foul niggas\nWhat the voice said, \"What up, pop? Who want it?\"\nI put the guap up, get the boy popped\nHe say \"Son, stop, it's dudes you feedin'\nWho feedin' other dudes, but they really not eatin'\"\nDog, why you callin' me? This our food\nYou handle the mouths that it trickles down to\nNiggas want beef, I want some of that cow too\nBut I'm in my princely robe, simply rich\nDon't bother me with silly shit, call Rico\nHe said \"It IS Rico, of all people\nGave his moms furs, called up the mayor\nTo get his crime pardoned, his son's godfather\"\nSaid the nigga shot up my cars\nLast night he laid for me to come out my doors?\n[Chorus]\nNiggas always on that bullshit\nTo make a nigga wanna open up a full clip\nNiggas always on that bullshit\nNow your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit\nNiggas always on that bullshit\nTo make a nigga wanna open up a full clip\nNiggas always on that bullshit\nNow your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit\nYou can't kill me\n\n[Verse 2]\nHigh, fly, send a fella loaf or glass\nFold up cash, you ain't heard the soldier's half\nYou speakin' hogwash, silly shit, Balderdash\nI got the live sparked, Phillies lit, smoker's jacket on\nThe son of a Cap-ricorn, my dad's a don\nWhat you think that he spawned? A slacker? Nah\nPacked the 9's, yo this nigga's asinine\nSmack your mom, relaxed and calm, then mack your mom\nIn a casket, you'll get your fashion on\nYou'll be in a suit and tie, you'll die\nYou'll make maggots turn to flies, fuckin' with Nas\nRemember anyone can get it at anytime\nLames'll swear by your name, when they lie\nGet hit with the lone star, ripped where your bones are\nSo tell me how yo' ass gon' run, from a C-Z-P-0-1?\nIn the midst of real steel movers, you a loser\nMerk you wit your own shooters\nAll you want is a name, pissed and insane\nMy security system, my playspot a fireplace, listen\nThen it goin' off, start spittin'\nNiggas try to bring it where I live in\nTrustin' you, knew where all of the cribs at\nSo we waited with the Sigs, blat, blat, blat!\n[Chorus]\nNiggas always on that bullshit\nTo make a nigga wanna open up a full clip\nNiggas always on that bullshit\nNow your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit\nNiggas always on that bullshit\nTo make a nigga wanna open up a full clip\nNiggas always on that bullshit\nNow your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit\nYou can't kill me\n\n[Outro]\nYou can't kill me\nYou can't kill me\nYou can't kill me3Embed"

WHAT?\n[Chorus]\nWhen they crown you and you rise up to your position\nCarry on tradition\nWhen they knight you, then you go to fight\nGo to war, don't petition, carry on tradition\nCarry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition\nCarry On Tradition\nWhen you rep what we rep, then carry on tradition\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow niggas got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer\nEngineers got his earplugs and still hear us\nThe live-in-the-park sound versus the studio state of art sound. We on the charts now\nFrom British Walkers and Argyles\nLook at us rap stars now, with our black cars now\nFortune 500 listed, brunches, Cipriani's\nSippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me\nThick white girls around me, Chinese lined up\nBecause I'm what? Every dime lust\nWe used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up\nIf I want that or the whole world to peep it\nNow carry on tradition\nFuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'\nPeace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em, I promise I carry on tradition\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen they crown you and you rise up to your position\nCarry on tradition\nWhen they knight you, then you go to fight\nGo to war, don't petition, carry on tradition\nCarry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition\nCarry On Tradition\nWhen you rep what we rep, then carry on tradition3Embed"

Stick-ups and killings\nKidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings\nCriticize that, why's that?\n\u2018Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crack\n\u2018Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens\nMost intellectuals will only half listen\nSo you can't blame jazz musicians\nOr David Stern with his NBA fashion issues\nOh, I think they like me, in my white tee\nYou can't ice me, we here for life, B\nOn my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey\nAnd for that, we not taking it lightly\nIf hip hop should die, we die together\nBodies in the morgue lie together, all together now\n[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\n(Hip hop just died this morning\nHip hop just died this morning\nHip hop just died this morning\nAnd she's dead, she's dead)\n\n[Outro Verse: Nas]\nEverybody sound the same, commercialize the game\nReminiscing when it wasn't all business\nIt forgot where it started\nSo we all gather here for the dearly departed\nHip-hopper since a toddler\nOne homeboy became a man, then a mobster\nIf it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka\nRIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta\nWent from turntables to MP3's\nFrom \"Beat Street\" to commercials on Mickey D's\nFrom gold cables to Jacobs\nFrom plain facials to Botox and face lifts\nI'm looking over my shoulder\nIt's about 80 people from my hood that showed up\nAnd they came to show love\nSold out concert and the doors are closed shut23Embed"

(Hahaha)\nLet's go... uhh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uh\nTurn the music up in the headphones\nUh, yeah, that's perfect (yeah, right, right)\nUhh, uh, you gotta take ya time, make a nigga wait on this muh'fucka (hahaha!)\nMake niggas mad and shit like\nNiggas usually just start rappin' after four bars, nigga, go in!\nJust start dancin' in this muh'fucka\nYeah, (yeah) we just come outta nowhere\n[Chorus: Jay-Z (Nas)]\nI feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in\nCan't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them\nCan't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)\nProbably end up back in the hood, like, \"Fuck it then\"\n[Verse 1: Jay-Z (Nas)]\nHuddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then (what?)\nThough you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend\nWe had covenant, who would've thought the love would end?\nLike Ice Cold's album (uhh), all good things\nNever thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang\nThought it was all wood-grain, all good brain\nWe wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game\nNever imagine all the disaster that one good reign, could bring\nShould blame, the game, and I could\nIt's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?\nAnd forever be in debt, and that's never a good thing\nSo the pressure for success can put a good strain\nOn a friend you call best, and yes it could bring\nOut the worst in every person, even the good and sane\nAlthough we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same\nWhen you put in the game at age sixteen\nThen you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and Miss Thing\nJealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings\nIt all to a head like a coin, cha-ching\nThe root of evil strikes again, this could sting\nNow the team got beef between the Post and the Point\nThis puts the ring in jeopardy \u2013 indefinitely\n[Chorus: Jay-Z & Nas]\nI feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in\nCan't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)\nCan't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)\nProbably end up back in the hood, I'm like, \"Fuck it then\"\nI feel like a black militant takin' over the government\nCan't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them (nah)\nCan't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him\nProbably end up back in the hood, I'm like, \"Fuck it then\"\n\n[Verse 2: Nas (Jay-Z)]\nI'm back in the hood, they like, \"Hey Nas\" (uh)\nBlowin' on purp, reflectin' on they lives (uh)\nCouple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s\nDreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies\nGray 5s, hatah's wishin' our reign dies\nPitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, \"Why\"? (uhh)\nGuess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time\nWeak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs\nI'm standing on the roof of my building\nI'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it\nJust like an acrobat ready to hurl myself, through the hoops of fire\nSippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire\nCould it be the forces of darkness\nAgainst hood angels of good, that form street politics?\nMakes a sweet honest kid, turn illegal for commerce (uhh)\nTo get his feet out of them Converse \u2013 that's my word\n[Chorus: Jay-Z & Nas]\nI feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in\nCan't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)\nCan't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)\nProbably end up back in the hood, ah, \"Fuck it then\"\nI feel like a black militant takin' over the government\nCan't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them\nCan't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him\nProbably end up back in the hood, I'm like, \"Fuck it then\"19Embed"

Babe, babe, start the car!\n*Car engine starts*\nNasir, come on, let's go!(Bitch-ass niggas!)\nYeah! Now what? Haha!\nGet in the car now, let's go! Yeah let's go\n*car door closes* Throw it out, let's go!\nAight, aight, aight, yeah\nBut I got 'em. But I got 'em, though\nThis is crazy, why didn't you just throw it out of the car?\nThis is so stupid, what are you doing?\nWhy are we even out here?\nWhy are we out here? What's going on?\nThis is retarded, yo, we gotta\u2026\nThis is crazy. Never again\nYou'd throw everything away, for what?\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nYeah, my man Kool G Rap told me, \"Son, do not look back\"\nChill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax\nWhen people act, school em' with facts, tell 'em\nAt this point in my life I'm all about chillin'\nRidin' around in something sick and the dress flies\nAnd twist, homie's hermano just died, I gotta let it ride\nThat's what I got the public thinkin', my nigga\nJust \u2018cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit, my nigga\nI know who died before the body dropped\nI know the guns that were used\nHow much money the shooter got\n\u2018Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all\nThe top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time\nIs all we talk when we talk in New York, y'all\nWho to call and who to stay away from\nWhose mother's address to have just to play it safe, son\nWomen they lust up so quick to give 'em up\nWhat cars and what trucks they drive in\nWhat towns they spend the most time in when they grindin'\nI found out most of them are cowards\nThey hidin' behind reputations that's sour; I'm not going back\n\n[Chorus: Kelis and Nas]\nThe streets keep tryin' to say\nCome back around this way\nI've already gone that way\nI won't come back again\nI'm not going back!\nStreets keep tryin' to say\nCome back around this way\nI've already gone that way\nI won't come back again\nI'm not going back!\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nFirst thing that happen when you make a little paper\nYou think the Marriott is livin' in a skyscraper\nTill you come across some even more flyer paper\nRealize that five-star tellies are even greater\nTerry-cloth robes, elegance, movie shit\nHeated-up marble floors with jacuzzis in it\nFirst-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes\nAll those things, you still ain't really doing shit, kid\n\u2018Cause in reality, I'll earn my salary\nThe way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me\nIt kinda make me wanna hate bling\nIt's a race thing how they sell blacks the bootleg shit\nIn fact, real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings\nWhores charge niggas with raping\n\u2018Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars\nWatch us make bets on race tracks, smokin' cigars\nSo they counter the laws to take what's ours\n'Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge\nSo you can't stop us from making a billion dollars\nInstead of going back, I'm buying the projects\nBut I'm not going back\nThe hood's in me forever y'all, but I'm not going back\n\n[Chorus: Kelis and Nas]\nThe streets keep tryin' to say\nCome back around this way\nI've already gone that way\nI won't come back again\nI'm not going back!\nStreets keep tryin' to say\nCome back around this way\nI've already gone that way\nI won't come back again\nI'm not going back!\n[Break: Nas]\nAnd of course y'all know what I'm not going back to\nThose no friends of mine\u2026 (And I'm not going back to)\nTen carat gold, no shine\u2026 (And I'm never going back to)\nSony, if they don't have dough to resign\u2026\n(Not going back to)\nY'all know that I'm not going back to\nThose liars who would\u2026 (Not going back to)\nNot help you if they could\u2026 (Not going back to)\nCoke on the stove in the hood\u2026\nY'all should know that I'm not going back\nThe hood's in me forever y'all, but I'm not going back\n\n[Chorus: Kelis and Nas]\nThe streets keep tryin' to say (Ugh)\nCome back around this way\nI've already gone that way (That's right)\nI won't come back again\nI'm not going back!\nStreets keep tryin' to say (Get off me!)\nCome back around this way (Don't try to pull me down man)\nI've already gone that way (I already did it)\nI won't come back again\nI'm not going back!3Embed"

What do you think 'bout?\nIf y'all get a divorce\nShe gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out\nMake it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out\nOr grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out\nYou now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle\nMeanwhile, she out doing the same thing now\nNightmares from your dream gal make you scream out\n[Chorus: Kanye West, Nas & Chrisette Michele]\nSome people really (Still dreamin')\nSome people really (Make you scream out)\nSome people really are (Still dreamin')\nStill dreamin' (Wha-wha-wha-wha-One-two one two)\nSome dreams stay dreams, some dreams come true\nThey are still dreamin'(Wha-wha-wha-wha-One-two one two)\nSome dreams stay dreams, some dreams come true\nSome people really (Yeah)\nSome people really (y-y-yeah)\nSome people really are (Ugh)\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nHow you a man waiting for the next man to get rich?\nYour plan is to stick out your hand real quick\nSo if he feed your family and he serve you shit\nThen he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch\nSince you wishin' cash fall from the sky all your life\nDwellin' on the past when you was alright\nWhen you was getting cash but wasn't too bright\nNow your luck down, you feel like bustin' them shells\nNobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self\nWant niggas to show you, how to come up with green\nI schemed since I'm 14, what the fuck was your dream?\nRental cars, little broads, saying you was seen\nWith little niggas with a chain, you was doing your thing\nHow high was I? You the thousandth guy\nThat came around thinking we can see eye to eye\nWe on a different echelon\nCould've got bread together, now you get skedded on\n[Refrain: Sample of Kanye West and Nas]\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nShe had several cars, she had credit cards\nA castle, large master bathroom, getting a pedicure\nBellinis by the glassful, said she been meaning to ask who\nWho in need of cash who, who could blast tools\nAnd I'm eating cashews, knew she was bad news\nBut we mad cool, nothin' sexual\n\u2018Cause I knew her since high school\nGrew up with my dudes, like one of my crew\nShe worked for Fox News\nOne of her mans that she lent her drop to\nWon't come back with it, so she want him clapped in it\nSays it's important that it looks like an accident\nShe was snorting and her eyes had bags in it\nShe was recording, had a wire, askin' shit\nFour days before I came by she got bagged with bricks\nCrossed the line from her world of news castin'\nTo a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards\n\n[Refrain: sample + Kanye and Nas]\n\n[Sample of \"They are still dreaming\" to end]18Embed"

Mayfield)]\nYeah, Feds feast on street dons, look at their teeth showin'\nSalivating at the mouth, South to East Orange\nKeep pourin' that liquor, but nigga don't sleep on it\nYou'll be giving up your Jesus piece to your peeps to pawn it\nFor legal fees in the penal dorm\nScreamin' on the horn with 'bout 30 years on your conscience\nI'm watchin' brothers disappear, it's appallin'\nSome dudes had just only a year of ballin'\nCounter-intelligence found a strange evidence\n(When the block is hot)\nStill we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates\nPosition we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in\nWaves spinnin' like Mike Bivens from New Edition agin'\n(I gotta... when the block is hot)\nI got families I'm feedin', 'cause my mans is bleedin'\nEvery five seconds look in all directions\nI come through prepared, I give 'em a call\n\"I'm close, bring them guns downstairs\"\n[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield (Nas)]\nI gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot\nI gotta use my imagination to change the situation\nI gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot (hold it down)\nI gotta use my imagination to change the situation\n\n[Verse 2: Nas (Mark B.

Mayfield (Nas)]\nI gotta hold down the block when the block is hot\nI gotta use my imagination to change the situation\nI gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot (yeah, word to mother)\nI gotta use my imagination, to change the situation (yeah)\n\n[Verse 3: Nas (Mark B. Mayfield)]\n(I gotta...) Anytime brothers can't get jobs, then they rob\nA man rather die than live on his knees and starve\nCops steady askin' your man what happened\nFirst he tell, then he stop, like he not really rattin'\nGuess he not really in that casket from a sawed-off\n(When the block is hot)\nListen, peep game from the brain of an all-star\nThe rain hurt niggas' bones who been shot\nMetal pins in their leg, they walk with a limp-hop\nThe streets lie (when the block is hot), so you better be cautious\nYour man'll fry you plus everybody talkin'\nA vet, a General, don't step where I walked in\nMake your own path, be a legend in your skin\n(Hold down the block, when the block is hot)\nMake your own cash, don't stress what I'm flossin'\nDon't expect more when you put in less work than all them\nQueensbridge projects has taught him\nAnd that's for life, you heard me right, I got the block\n[Outro: Mark B.

Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nAnd will the money and fame outlast me?\nThe blunts ash falls down in the ashtray\nWell, I see my whole life fly past me\nI'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nDid I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me\n\n[Verse 2]\nSam trusted Womack with his main lady\nHe tossing in the grave like, \"This is how you repay me?!\"\nA change gon' come, wish you didn't trust me so much\nMarvin said \"No mountain's high enough,\" fly stuff\nDavid Ruffin was punchin' Tammi Terrell\nGave her concussions\nWhile the Funk Brothers was laying down the percussion\nWhen Flo from the Surpremes died, Diana Ross cried\nMany people said that she was laughin' inside\n[Hook]\nAs the blunt ash falls into the ash tray\nI could see my whole life fly past me\nDid I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nAnd will the money and fame outlast me?\nThe blunts ash falls down in the ashtray\nWell, I see my whole life fly past me\nI'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nDid I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me\n\n[Verse 3]\nJohn F. Kennedy's enemies dealt with treachery\nIt interests me. Judy Campbell in Gucci sandals\nShe's what a temptress be\nThe death of Ennis Cosby, what a mystery!\nOr the Chicagoan Harold Washington\nSomeone is sabotaging 'em\nWatch out for the traps\nLarry Troutman killed his brother Roger Troutman\nThen he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp\nAnd I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats\nThis is what came from their pain\nFrom their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange\n\n[Hook]\nAs the blunt ash falls into the ash tray\nI could see my whole life fly past me\nDid I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nAnd will the money and fame outlast me?\nThe blunts ash falls down in the ashtray\nWell, I see my whole life fly past me\nI'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nDid I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me\n[Outro]\nI could smell old Bogey cigars\nLauren Bacall perfumes, smelling just as sweet\nMe and my wife K, flying in a drop-top\nLike Ruby and Ossie Davis, baby \u2013 know what I mean?\nYo, man, I get smoked out, and start thinking 'bout\nHattie McDaniel got a Oscar\nFor playing Mammy in \"Gone with the Wind\"\nAnd she didn't get allowed\nWasn't even allowed to go to the premier\nBelieve that? Couldn't go to premier to her joint\nMan, you know they were strong back then, man\nBlunt from my ashtray, nothing gon' to live past me, yeah3Embed"

Think maybe like a trillion figures\nPray my daughter don't wild like the Hilton sisters\nThat'd kill me yo, filthy rich\nMy daughter pass it onto the next generation\nThrowing carnations at my tombstone\nIn my new home, meet Mom's in my Yves Saint Laurent suit on\nThen we do a dance\nLike my man Luther jam, but my verse came first\nI stole change out her purse, now I wanna dig her up\nOutta the earth, too morbid, lean forward\nToward a new paragraph, Blue carrots, D-class\nStrictly that kush in the weed bags\nTryna' figure out what Barry Gordie had put in production\nStudio's smokey now, hard like David Ruffin\nHit a spliff through a seance, and uh, play on, playa\n[Hook: Snoop Dogg]\nFinest females I spit game on, I sprayed her\nGotta' get your papes on, play on, playa\nBefore it's all gone, sip Don, tip waiters\nDo y'all thing, m\u00e9nage, swing, baby\nSpend dubs on your bruhs, gotta live crazy\nFinest females I spit game on, I sprayed her\nGet your papes on, play on, playa\nGet your papes on, play on, playa\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nRuby red grapefruit juice with Grey Goose\nRubies in the Jesus piece, pimped out like Snoopy\nBut a East Coast thing, my girl's stocking\nTied up in a knot top of my bean head\nBillion dollar dream head, went from triple beams to digitals\nServin' fiends to minimal, sixty G's\nNo criminal, no mo', just mo' dough\nMimosas pouring, Oprah's earrings\nOn fingers while your girl performs cunnilingus\n\u2018Cause this big money aroma lingers\nBarber cleans his blade, then they give me a fade\nHot towel on the face, hot models who vomit\nAfter they eat so they can stay lightweight\nSwallowin' my protein like an Ovaltine shake\nCome through like Mo Green from Godfather, so clean\nWhere I step I 'Clorox it', keep twenty G's\nOn both sides of the thighs, that's four pockets\nEighty thou to browse for the nicest price\nBut we ain't into buyin' conflict ice\nThat's the shit they stole from the Congo, and other black soil\nTrue mack fo' you, nappy hair just spinning\nHoney gave me a massage with a happy ending\nFinest females, I just came on and sprayed her\nGot to get your papes on, play on, playa\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Snoop]\nIt's kinda hard for a playa like you\nBut let me show you how a nigga like me get revenue\nWhat you never do is punk out, what you better do\nNever let the game get ahead of you, get a better view\nBetter yet, a better crew, praise God, I'm a marry you\nGet ya holy, carry you, bury you, slowly\nRoll me another blunt, stuff it\nLick it, puff it, tuck it, fuck it\nThat man, that game, that thing it busts\nIn D-O-Double-G we trust\nYup, yup, young loc with the two steps\nHe creepin' with two TEC's, they sleepin' with two chicks\nRight before we blast, all you heard was two clicks (Bloaw!)\nEnd of existence, for instance\nRewind, replay it, re-chop it, remix it, re-twist it\nGoddamn, D-O-Double-G, cuz, we missed it\nTravel slow, I'm an Indian, but not a Navajo\nI smoke the big leaf, end all the big beefs\nMy hair in two braids, I'm the big chief\nLa-da-da, be-da-ba-da\u2026\nYeah, break that down, how fresh you are?\nThe king from Queens, Mr. Escobar\nConnect with the best from the West, yes-yes, you are\nOh my God, it's Snoop Dogg and Nas; playa, play on6Embed"
