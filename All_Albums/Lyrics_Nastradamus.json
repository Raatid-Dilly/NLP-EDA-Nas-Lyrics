Yo these streets don't allow you to blink\nYou get showered by lead, coming out with your mink\nBow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles\nDump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico\nIt's hard fucking with niggas you hope you can trust\nYou a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck\nAnd you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?\nShit is devious, ex-friends wanting you stuck\n[Chorus]\nIt's the life we chose, where friends become foes\nAnd the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know\nThis is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes\nAnd the only way out, is death or going broke\nThis the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings\nThat's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it\nAnd I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..\nThis life is the only life I know...\n\n[Verse 2]\nUhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?\nHe wanna stick you\nWhat's love, you got beef?\nNobody rolling with you\nWhat's love, you locked up, and your family don't care\nIs love a four-letter word, that deceives the ear?\nWhat's real, when you know your man's girl is a ho\nAnd you don't even let him know, 'cause you fucked her befo'\nWhat's real, when you talk behind a man's back\nThen you see him and give him dap, now explain that?\nWhat's trust, when they separate your case\nWhen you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face\nWhat's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?\nAnd he never crossed you, but you claiming he's fam'?\nWhat's trust, when you get bust, your niggas don't retaliate?\nThey blaze purple haze with 'em the next day?\nGod forbid one of my niggas get hit, I'ma go haywire\nWon't hesitate, I'ma spray fire\nBut everybody's different, you won't know how you react\nTil you in that position, and that's an actual fact\nThe hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?\nYou was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you\nWho's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90\nOn your deathbed you regret being grimy\nWhat's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug?\nA ghetto child raised around drugs 'til he's old enough to bust slugs?\nThen what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse\nWhen he come home to catch another case?\nLife's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it\nYou did it, heaven or hell or prison\nWho knows when your clock'll stop ticking, get your weight up\nSave up before it's over neighbor, I told ya\nYou getting older player, look at those who gave up\n[Chorus]\nIt's the life we chose, where friends become foes\nAnd the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know\nThis is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes\nAnd the only way out, is death or going broke\nThis the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings\nThat's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it\nAnd I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..\nThis life is the only life I know...4Embed"

Could it be a jack?\nNow pull my strap, it's my man and we have the same plan\nThere them bitches go, Civic '94\nLooking funny though, open up the car door, funny smile\nFuck two already, third ass was heavy\n\"Nas this is Sherry, Sherry this is Nas and his man, ready?\"\nWalked in the house, snatched off they clothes\nRan through them hoes, plenty ice, that they all seemed to like\nCan't find my man, heard a blam-blam\nNow I'm wondering, \"In this scam, do I even stand a chance?\"\nHe killed the hoes, took all they dough\nFire in his eyes, higher than the sky coming down the stairs\nNow he wanting mine, reaching for my nine\nAiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time\nMy nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering\n\"Put your gun down, we can skip town\"\nRocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat\nLift off his chain, took his shit, emptied out close range\n[Chorus]\nShoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?\n(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)\nShoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?\n(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)\nShoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?\nShoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?\n(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)5Embed"

little girl)\nYou a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul\nYou could be aborting the next Michael Jordan\nYour man don't wanna be around\n(You're a big girl now)\nShe's sexy, she got it, she ride it\nEvery nigga wanna be inside it, uhh\n(No more daddy's little girl)\nI need her, I'll eat her\nDo anything to please her\nMy ghetto queen of Sheba\n[Verse 1]\nI'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace\nGet you hype when I lick it, put it by your face\nSipping red wine, is it bedtime\nYou can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith\nI'm feeling richer today,I can hit it then stay\nLingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play\nWe got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice\nBubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right\nIt's your night, no stress, no fight\nMad at your ex, 'cause his dough tight\nNever go right when you're with him\nTry your best to forget him\n'Cause it's easy to please me\nCD skip when your head board hit the wall\nCall for the lord\nRight when you cum, I'm biting your tongue\nMake your legs cramp up, you can't stand up\nYou can hit a blunt if you want\nI'ma pull my pants up\nWe can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust\nTell me what's the reason for us\nTo love or to fuck\nI'm the thug that you want\nIf it's gangster we can't front\nIf you want me I can stay around\nIf you need me, I'm here for you\nHow that sound?\nNow it's up to you\nDepending on how you wanna get down\n'Cause you're a big girl now\n[Chorus]\n(You're a big girl now)\nFully grown with your hormones now\nGot your own home and you alone\nWanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out\n(No more daddy's little girl)\nYou a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul\nYou could be aborting the next Michael

anything to please her\nMy ghetto queen of Sheba\n\n[Verse 2]\nGot your name and your number in my cell phone\nHear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone\nIf you in a good mood, if you not\nOr you thinking bout you was at my spot\nWhat we did when we got hot\nIs you dreaming you had me?\nIs you creaming your panties?\nLike a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me\nOn the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink\nAnd we ate each other like candy\nUnder the covers, two intimate lovers\nYou fuck a nigga like you mad at me\nThrow the ass to me\nYou should be glad to be\nIn the presence of a real thug as bad as me\nWhile I'm in the streets with my murdering squad\nYou talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard\nHow I'm making my rod, how I make you say \"Oh God\"\nEvery ho that you know wanna know Nas\nGotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard\n'Cause you know how these girls are\nWearing tight shit, no panties, no bra\nRunning up to my car with menage a trois suggestions\nStarting to get an erection\nGuessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing\nComplexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave\nI need time to breathe\nWanna follow me, ironically\nYou pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe\nLike it's my fault\nBut you don't wanna talk\nDon't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden\nYou and the shorty start scuffing\nNow shorty dumping you out\nCan't let her get the best of you\nSo I rescue you\nOnly thing left to do was to grab her\nSo you can jab her, get a cheap shot\nYou don't wanna feel chumped\nNow here the cops come\nSo we gotta run to the ride\nThen we drive off through the traffic\nDon't panic, but you know how we gotta manage\nLooking at your face\nAnd the damage in your facial\nEvery angle can't let it faze you\nNo reason to be insecure or immature\nBaby girl, see the world is yours\n[Chorus]\n(You're a big girl now)\nFully grown with your hormones now\nGot your own home and you alone\nWanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out\n(No more daddy's little girl)\nYou a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul\nYou could be aborting the next Michael Jordan\nYour man don't wanna be

    "lyrics": "The Outcome Lyrics[Jessica Care Moore]\nGlobal warming between my legs, screams against the waves\nGave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water\nMy skin layered in diamonds and sage\nLeft alone in confused forest's, enslaved by days\nTime keeps on whorin us\nGhetto saviors can't keep ignorin us\nFlowers and flames flew from her fingers\nRifles pointed from her sac\nOr was it simply a bag of sticks and stones\nEither way, she wore a compass on her head\nRains don't stop the grass from turnin red\nHer hair was half permed, half dread\nWe gave up walking in a past-life and so we danced\nArms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life\nA new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice\nSymbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run\nTime travelling was late\nWatching was a blind man's mistake\nAll his assets melted right in front of his face\nHis right leg drabbed with demon pace\nShoes stayed angel laced\nNever count your blessings with haste\nEven a prophet can catch a case\nDidn't realize how sweet the future might taste\nTelepathically cutting through mental gates\nWords were weapons against their hate\nShepherds search for stars in her hair\nHer chest grew fermented like yeast\nShe broke her body like aged bread\nHe gave her truth from all the books he'd read\nShe wrote her poems inside the mud\nSacrificed her cervix to fix the future\nNamed their poison, spit truth inside his mouth\nRead warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly\nResurrected from bones and dirt\nShe made hard niggas smile\nLeft her seeds inside the Earth\nGave hustlers and killers life's worth\nThis is the life we chose, remember who was here first\nFind a reason why you curse\nGold rushed tongues by dreams too loose\nSporting electronic nooses\nHoeing humanity love takes over lust\nDespite the damage to Destiny\nYou can't take the best of me, In God We Still Trust3Embed"
