Getting put on to crack money\nWith all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry\nA case of beers in the staircase, I wasted years\nSome niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career\nBut I'm a rebel, stressing to pull out of the heat, no doubt\nWith Jeeps tinted out, spending, never holding out\n\n[Chorus]\nStreet dreams are made of these\nNiggas push Bimmers and 300 E's\nA drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key\nEverybody's looking for something\nStreet dreams are made of these\nShorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese\nWho am I to disagree?\nEverybody's looking for something\nStreet dreams are made of these\nNiggas push Bimmers and 300 E's\nA drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key\nEverybody's looking for something\nStreet dreams are made of these\nShorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese\nWho am I to disagree?\nEverybody's looking for something\n\n[Skit]\n*Gunshot*\n\"Yeah nigga, what?!\"\n\"Oh, shit!\"\n\"Queensbridge, boy, what?!

I go blaow\nIt's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul\nI might've took your first child\nScarred your life, or crippled your style\nI gave you power, I made you buck-wild\nHow you like me now? I go blaow\nIt's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul\nI might have took your first child\nScarred your life, or crippled your style\nI gave you power, I made you buck-wild\n[Verse 2]\nAlways I'm in some shit\nMy abdomen is the clip, the barrel's my dick\nUncircumcised, pull my skin back and cock me\nI bust off when they unlock me\nResults of what happens to niggas shock me\nI see niggas bleeding, running from me in fear\nStunningly, tears fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys\nFor years, I've been used in robberies\nGiving niggas heart to follow me\nPlacing peoples in graves, funerals made 'cause I was sprayed\nI was laid in a shelf wit' a grenade\nMet a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say:\nFive-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero\nHad a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place\nWhere he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him\nTired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun\nBut yo, I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on\nI make myself jam right in my owner's hand\n[Chorus]\nHow you like me now? I go blaow\nIt's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul\nI might have took your first child\nScarred your life, or crippled your style\nI gave you power, I made you buck-wild\nHow you like me now? I go blaow\nIt's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul\nI might have took your first child\nScarred your life, or crippled your style\nI gave you power, I made you buck-wild\n[Verse 3]\nYo, weeks went by and I'm surprised\nStill stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides\nBesides me, it's bullets, two vests and then a nine\nThere's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying\n'Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty, it's clear\nHe's 'bout to fall to pieces 'cause of his murder career\nYo, I can hear somebody coming in\nOpen the shelf, his eyes bubbling\nHe said it was on, I felt his palm troubled him\nShaking, somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching\nHe placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting\nMy creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks\nIt's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories\nBut this time, it's done intentionally\nHe walked me outside, saw this cat\nCocked me back, said, \"Remember me?\"\nHe pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong\nKnowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him\nHe squeezed harder, I didn't budge\nSick of the blood, sick of them thugs\nSick of wrath of the next man's grudge\nWhat the other kid did was pull out, no doubt\nA newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase\nMy owner fell to the floor, his wig split\nSo fast, I didn't know he was hit, it's over wit'\nHeard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming\nNow I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me\nDamn!47Embed"

(Uhh, what?)\nLiving reckless, die for my necklace\nCrime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish\nJetting, checking my message on the speaker\nBopping to \"Mona Lisa\", brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa\nCD cranking, doing 90 on the Franklin D. Roosevelt\nNo seat belt, drinking and thinking\nMy man caught a bad one, son, niggas is frightened\nSecret indictments, adds on the one seeking enlightenment\nMy Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow\nTraditions started by the school, not far from The Apollo\nMy 'fuck tomorrow' motto through the eyes of Pablo\nEscobar, the desperado, word to Cus D'Amato\n[Chorus: Nas & Foxy Brown]\nGotta watch dem niggas that's close to you\nAnd make sure they do what they supposed to do\n'Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you\nNever personal, nowadays it's the ways\nWatch dem niggas that's close to you\nAnd make sure they do what they supposed to do\n'Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you\nNever personal, nowadays it's the ways\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nSome niggas watch you (Uhh)\nSee you when you think you on the low, ain't hard to spot you\nYou swore to keep it real after you blow\nThree keys, new V's, went to Anguilla with your ho\nStayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough\nThem old timers advise you to them problems that's ahead\nDrama with the Feds, not listening, just bobbing your head\nYour Rollie shining, thinking to yourself \"Nobody's taking mine\"\nAt the same time, your ho is getting snatched from behind\nPut in a van, \"Where's the hundred grand?\", stripping her hand\nFrom all the ice, wouldn't you know\nYou knew these niggas all your life\nWhat made them mark you victim?\nYou fucked up somewhere down the line\nNow they had to target your Wisdom\nShe took 'em to your place, straight to your safe\nYou doubted it could happen, sick of yapping\nJump in your ride, headed to your side\nPuffing ganja, get to your crib, can't find her, just a reminder:\nShouldn't have your stash house where you crash out\nCould've passed out, your coke is gone, now you ass out\nDead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes\n\n[Chorus: Nas & Foxy Brown]\nGotta watch dem niggas that's close to you (Uhh)\nAnd make sure they do what they supposed to do (What, hah)\n'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (Uh)\nNever personal, nowadays it's the ways\nWatch dem niggas that's close to you (Uhh)\nAnd make sure they do what they supposed to do\n'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (Uh-huh)\nNever personal, nowadays it's the ways (Uhh)15Embed"

it like that, I'm livin' like that\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah, I never brag how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret\nI rock a vest prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus\nIn a Lex, watchin' Kathie Lee & Regis\nMy actions are one with the seasons\nA TEC squeezin' executioner\nWinter time, I rock a fur\nMega popular center of attraction\nClimaxin', my bitches, they be laughin'\nThey high from sniffin' coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson\nCity lights spark a New York night\nRossi and Martini sippin', Sergio Tacchini\nFlippin' mad pies, low price, I blow dice and throw them\n.45 by my scrotum, manifest the 'Do or Die' slogan\nMy niggas roll in ten M3's\nTwenty Gods poppin' wheelies on Kawasakis\nHip-hop's got me on some ol', sprayin' shots like a drum roll\nBlankin' out, never miscount the shells my gun hold\nI don't stunt, I regulate\nHenny and Sprite, I separate\nWatchin' crab niggas marinate\nI'm all about TEC's, a good jux and sex\nIsraelite books, holdin' government names from Ness\nMC's are crawlin' out every hole in the slum\nYou be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum\n[Hook]\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that\nFor you wack MC's\n\n[Verse 2]\nCurrency is made in the trust of the Messiah\nI'm spendin' it to get higher\nEarth, Wind and Fire singin' Reasons why I'm\nUp early, trustworthy as a nine that bust early\nSunshine on my grill, I spill\nRemy on imaginary graves\nPut my hat on my waves\nLatter Day Saints say religious praise\nI, dolo, challenge any team or solo\nYou must be buggin' out \u2014 new to my shit, home on a furlough\nAsk around who's laid up, sharp and straight up\nMafioso, gettin' niggas' wakes sprayed up\nSkies are misty, my life predicted by a gypsy\nI'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily\nThis be the drama, I'mma pause like a comma in a sentence\nParagraph's indented\nBloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye\nOpenin' cigars, let tobacco fly\nCondos are tune-proof, we're lookin' out the sky's moon-roof\nShittin' like gin and prune juice\nYo, the system wants the coon's noose \u2014 hang 'em high\nCourtrooms filled up\nIt's off the hook while I just wrote a statement\nLike I'm facin' twenty years in the basement\nChillin' on a VI with Mumia, for wearin' chrome\nI told the judge snakes slither like Sharon Stone\nBut like Capone, I'm thrown, yo\n[Hook]\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that\nFor you wack MC's\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that (Lyrical, ly-lyrical shine)\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that\nFor you wack MC's\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, the time is wastin', I use the mind elevation\nDime sack lacin', court pen pacin'\nIndividual, lyrical math abrasion\nPsychic evaluation, the foulest nation we livin' in\nDangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives\nA lifestyle on bad streets is patternized\nWise men build and destroy\nWhile the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealin' boy\nCoke suppliers actin' biased\n'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars\nBut every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired\nI still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's\nJust the killer in me, slash drug dealer, MC\nEx-slug filler, semi mug peeler\nDemi, bottles of Mo', yo, simply follow me flow\nPut poetry inside a crack pot and blow\nRough hoes pull crack out pussies and butt-holes\nBring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those\nWhy shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it?\nMy degrees are routed toward the peasy haired brick housing\nAnd studded-up, thick medallions\nRich niggas transportin' thousands\nForeign cash exchange amountin' to millions\nDoors is locked, rocks is chopped\nWatch the cameras in the ceilings\nTrick bitches catchin' mad feelings\nPeelin' off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheelin'\nI bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch\nWhen we catch them sex niggas with the TEC's you blessed, word\nSo now it's on, never wasted a slug\nTime is money, when it comes to mine, take it in blood\n[Hook]\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that\nFor you wack MC's\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that\nFor you wack MC's\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, Capone-N-Noreaga\nYeah, yo, official Queensbridge murderers\nMobb Deep keep it real, though\nMotherfuckin' AZ, yo\n'Mega, 'Mega, whatever\nScarlett O'Hara, Fox Boogie\nEast New York\nYambo, Brownsville\nWizard, Far Rockaway\nBig Bo, Jersey\nConnecticut, DC, Sudan\nVA, NC, LA\nSo on and so on\nBig Ha, Houston Fifth Ward\nBlack Ed, keep it real, Moe37Embed"
