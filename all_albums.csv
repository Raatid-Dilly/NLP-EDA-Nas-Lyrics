1.0,The Genesis,Illmatic,1994,"The Genesis Lyrics[Produced by Faith N & Nas]
[Nas]
Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr. Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was 12, I went to…
[Hector]
And you're sitting at home doing this shit
I should be earning a medal for this
Stop fuckin' around and be a man
There ain't nothin' out here for you
[Zoro]
Oh yes, there is… This

2.0,N.Y. State of Mind,Illmatic,1994,"N.Y. State of Mind Lyrics[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;
[Verse 1]
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm
I be kickin', musician inflictin' composition
Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind
[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Verse 2]
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind
[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

3.0,Life’s a Bitch,Illmatic,1994,"Life’s a Bitch Lyrics[Produced by L.E.S. & Nas]

[Intro: AZ and Nas]
Ayo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!
[Verse 1: AZ]
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
'Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, 'cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die

[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
[Verse 2: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated 'cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, 'cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die

4.0,The World Is Yours,Illmatic,1994,"The World Is Yours Lyrics[Produced by Pete Rock]
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
[Verse 1: Nas]
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I’m throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
[Verse 2: Nas]
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life (It's yours)
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches, aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead in right direction
How you livin'? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
Yo, the world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
[Bridge]
Break it down
It's yours, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours

[Verse 3: Nas]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? (Yeah)
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)

[Outro: Nas & Pete Rock]
(Break it down) Yeah, aight
To everybody in Queens, the foundation (It's yours)
The world is yours
To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours (It's yours)
The world is yours
To everybody in Brooklyn
Y'all know the world is yours (It's yours)
The world is yours
Everybody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours (It's yours)
Long Island, yo, the world is yours (It's yours)
Staten Island, yeah, the world is yours (It's yours)
South Bronx, the world is yours (It's yours)

5.0,Halftime,Illmatic,1994,"Halftime Lyrics[Produced by Large Professor]

[Intro]
(Right… Right…)
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

[Verse 1]
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'm a ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change, I'm a performer, strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime
[Chorus]
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Ayo, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel
[Verse 2]
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react, never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap
I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime
[Chorus]
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

[Verse 3]
I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
But chill, pass to Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out
[Outro]
(Right…) It's still halftime
(Right…) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right…) '92, it's halftime
(Right…) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost

[Intro]
Aight, fuck that shit! Word, word
Fuck that other shit, y'know what I'm sayin'?
We gonna do a lil somethin' like this
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
(Stay up on that shit)
Keep it on and on and on and on and
Know'm sayin'? Big Nas, Grand Wizard, God, what is it?
(It's like…) Haha, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, go ahead and rip that shit, dun!
[Verse 1]
I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' match, from craps to cee-lo
With side-bets, so roll a deuce, nothin' below
(Peace, God!) Peace, God – now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that, y'all…

[Chorus]
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
[Verse 2]
One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God
Check the prognosis: Is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis; my razor embraces many faces
You're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say ""Peace""
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes, 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane
[Chorus]
""Now, let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now, let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

7.0,One Love,Illmatic,1994,"One Love Lyrics[Produced by Q-Tip]

[Verse 1: Nas]
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged—plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!
[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 2: Nas]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love
[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 3: Nas]
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together, in the Bridge we call 'em ""oo-wops""
He said: ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
‘Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Outro: Nas]
To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge and all over
To my man [Goon?], one love
To my man Herb, one love

One time 4 your mind, one time
Yo, whatever
One time 4 your mind, one time
A-yo, Nas
What up, pah?
Kick that fuckin' rhyme!
Check it out!
[Verse 1: Nas]
When I'm chillin', I grab the buddha, get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and rootin' for the villain, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After bein' blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin'
Keep lubrication, Lifestyle protection
Pickin' up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck — rockin' the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well, a cappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, hops, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Y'all niggas was born, I shot my way out my mom dukes
When I was ten, I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop
Known for rockin' microphones and twistin' off a 40 top

[Chorus 2: Grand Wizard + Nas]
One time 4 your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time 4 your mind, one time
It sound clever
A-yo, Nas, fuck that, man, that shit was phat
But kick that for them gangstas, man, fuck all that!
Right, right
[Verse 2: Nas]
What up, niggas? How y'all? It's Nasty, the villain
I'm still writin' rhymes, but besides that, I'm chillin'
I'm tryin' to get this money, God — you know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold, be starvin' make you wanna do crimes, kid
But I'mma lamp ‘cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catchin' 3-to-9's, Muslims yellin' ""Free the mind!""
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid, when I would say that outta town, niggas chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind, plus control a 9
Fine, see, now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights, then inhale, it stimulates
Floatin' like I'm on the North 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write, my hand is hot
And expand the lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make your heads bop, pah
I shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I've raided
I hold a MAC-11, and attack a reverend
I contact eleven L's and max in heaven
[Chorus 3: Grand Wizard + Nas]
One time 4 your mind, one time
It sounds clever
One time 4 your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time 4 your mind, one time
Yo, from '92 to '99

[Outro]
Yeah, that shit was crazy phat, pah
Know what I’m sayin'?
But check it, you got another verse for me
I want you to kick it, you know what I'm sayin'?
Kick that shit for the projects, know what I'm sayin'?48Embed"

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 1]
Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers
We all stare at the out-of-towners
(Aiyyo, yo, who that?) They better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure
[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 2]
Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
[Verse 3]
No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom, then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Bokeem, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love

[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell
[Verse 2]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell
[Verse 3]
This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell124Embed"

[Verse 1]
Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes
32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on millenniums
20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec
To chase the Henny, wet any clique with the semi TEC
Who want it? Diamonds I flaunt it
Chickenheads flock I lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him—what was he thinkin'?
On my corner when it's pay-me time
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me ""Plug him!""
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up, it went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin'
All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' Ls, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together uptown coppin' the raw
But, uh—a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers (Word up)

A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
[Verse 1]
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real, G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God's sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings?

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
[Verse 2]
From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou' from being rich
But now, I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel, Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM'
Word is bond, son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
[Verse 3]
Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'ing, heard about them old timers OD'ing
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshiping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase, I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel, stressing to pull out of the heat, no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending, never holding out

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Intro]
Damn
Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me, right
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfucking gun
I can't believe this shit
Word up, word up
[Verse 1]
I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me, bullets spray
They use me wrong, so I sing this song to this day
My body is cold steel, for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats, they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches, four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered
They pull me out, I watch as niggas scattered
Making me kill, but what I feel, it never mattered
When I'm empty, I'm quiet
Finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves, under beds
So I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keeping me full up with hollow heads
[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might've took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
[Verse 2]
Always I'm in some shit
My abdomen is the clip, the barrel's my dick
Uncircumcised, pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding, running from me in fear
Stunningly, tears fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys
For years, I've been used in robberies
Giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made 'cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf wit' a grenade
Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say:
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand
[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
[Verse 3]
Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me, it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying
'Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty, it's clear
He's 'bout to fall to pieces 'cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody coming in
Open the shelf, his eyes bubbling
He said it was on, I felt his palm troubled him
Shaking, somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge
Sick of the blood, sick of them thugs
Sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split
So fast, I didn't know he was hit, it's over wit'
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!47Embed"
5.0,Watch Dem Niggas,It Was Written,1996,"Watch Dem Niggas Lyrics[Produced by Trackmasters]

[Verse 1: Nas]
They never realized how real Nas is, so decisive
It's just the likeness of Israelites mist that made me write this
A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chasing down your primetime
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan features the freak shit
My thesis on how we creep quick
Fucking your wife, that ain't no secret
It's mandatory, see, that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggas never handle for me
My gator brand is Mauri, walking through rough land before me
Where the snakes put a smile on they face
Hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping, they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rocked stages
Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really, it's papers I'm addicted to
Wasn't for rap, then I'd be sticking you
The MAC inside the Triple Goose
Face down on the floor's the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam
Just cream or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that, that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant
[Chorus: Nas & Foxy Brown]
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways

[Verse 2: Nas]
Now, how can I perfect this? (Uhh, what?)
Living reckless, die for my necklace
Crime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker
Bopping to ""Mona Lisa"", brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa
CD cranking, doing 90 on the Franklin D. Roosevelt
No seat belt, drinking and thinking
My man caught a bad one, son, niggas is frightened
Secret indictments, adds on the one seeking enlightenment
My Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow
Traditions started by the school, not far from The Apollo
My 'fuck tomorrow' motto through the eyes of Pablo
Escobar, the desperado, word to Cus D'Amato
[Chorus: Nas & Foxy Brown]
Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
[Verse 3: Nas]
Some niggas watch you (Uhh)
See you when you think you on the low, ain't hard to spot you
You swore to keep it real after you blow
Three keys, new V's, went to Anguilla with your ho
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough
Them old timers advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listening, just bobbing your head
Your Rollie shining, thinking to yourself ""Nobody's taking mine""
At the same time, your ho is getting snatched from behind
Put in a van, ""Where's the hundred grand?"", stripping her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know
You knew these niggas all your life
What made them mark you victim?
You fucked up somewhere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took 'em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen, sick of yapping
Jump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffing ganja, get to your crib, can't find her, just a reminder:
Shouldn't have your stash house where you crash out
Could've passed out, your coke is gone, now you ass out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes

[Chorus: Nas & Foxy Brown]
Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you (Uhh)
And make sure they do what they supposed to do (What, hah)
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (Uh)
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you (Uhh)
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (Uh-huh)

[Hook]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I never brag how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex, watchin' Kathie Lee & Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A TEC squeezin' executioner
Winter time, I rock a fur
Mega popular center of attraction
Climaxin', my bitches, they be laughin'
They high from sniffin' coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sippin', Sergio Tacchini
Flippin' mad pies, low price, I blow dice and throw them
.45 by my scrotum, manifest the 'Do or Die' slogan
My niggas roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods poppin' wheelies on Kawasakis
Hip-hop's got me on some ol', sprayin' shots like a drum roll
Blankin' out, never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate
Watchin' crab niggas marinate
I'm all about TEC's, a good jux and sex
Israelite books, holdin' government names from Ness
MC's are crawlin' out every hole in the slum
You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum
[Hook]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For you wack MC's

[Verse 2]
Currency is made in the trust of the Messiah
I'm spendin' it to get higher
Earth, Wind and Fire singin' Reasons why I'm
Up early, trustworthy as a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill
Remy on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints say religious praise
I, dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be buggin' out — new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, gettin' niggas' wakes sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'mma pause like a comma in a sentence
Paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye
Openin' cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're lookin' out the sky's moon-roof
Shittin' like gin and prune juice
Yo, the system wants the coon's noose — hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up
It's off the hook while I just wrote a statement
Like I'm facin' twenty years in the basement
Chillin' on a VI with Mumia, for wearin' chrome
I told the judge snakes slither like Sharon Stone
But like Capone, I'm thrown, yo
[Hook]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For you wack MC's

[Verse 3]
Yo, the time is wastin', I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacin', court pen pacin'
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation we livin' in
Dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealin' boy
Coke suppliers actin' biased
'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's
Just the killer in me, slash drug dealer, MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo, simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and butt-holes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it?
My degrees are routed toward the peasy haired brick housing
And studded-up, thick medallions
Rich niggas transportin' thousands
Foreign cash exchange amountin' to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped
Watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catchin' mad feelings
Peelin' off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheelin'
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the TEC's you blessed, word
So now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money, when it comes to mine, take it in blood

Motherfucking Dre (Ahh), whassup my nigga?
Sup Nas?
Chilling, God
Niggas is up in here hittin' some of this chronic, nigga
Yeah and this chocolate over here, they mixed this shit up
Nigga, hit some of this shit, nigga
Yeah, lemme get that
I'm tired of these niggas, niggas stealin' beats
And niggas is stealin' your whole techniques and shit
Niggas wanna take everything from a nigga, man
Yeah, yeah, yo, Nas, it's like this, man
Niggas can't do it like I do it, d'yaknahmsayin'?
Just like niggas can't do what you do
Right, right
You know, can't nobody fuck with this
You know, all these niggas out here just
Talkin' this East coast/West coast bullshit
Niggas need to kill that shit
And make some money, y'know
Word
Fuck it
What is it, what is it, God?
Let's get together, make some fuckin' music
Right, that's what I'm sayin', that's what I'm sayin'
And get paid, and just, let that be it
Right, right
All these niggas talkin' all this bullshit
Better sit back, and watch what happens
[Verse 1: Nas]
The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holding out
Let the streets be the court and corners hold the trial
Fatal, not fictitious
I rock the cable '86 shit
Foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Soliciting ill editions of that Murder I Wrote
A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on the top of the sand
In the heat of the moment
Like Farrakhan said, we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes
Chrome kitted up, calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts
I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutching gats, quick to bust
But knowing how these niggas tattle
I sneak move, get the drop, one shot without the gun battle
So when you run, the lead travels
I come through, it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
[Verse 2: Nas]
In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands to make examples
Substantial amounts you owe to the fam'
Crew, Firm affiliation, paper chasing
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado, blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be real
But impostors to Hoffa, Nas plague kills
Counting bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to LA, QB to CPT for GP
A hundred G cars, Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout - murder material, serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's something venereal
But back in stereo

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)

[Verse 3: Nas]
From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent, stay splifted
Control the rap game? You got it twisted
Dr. Dre way, the 'Bridge say ""Shake dice and kiss it""
Sip Cris', push the six with biscuit
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen, y'all
Nas, y'all, fly gangsta, wavy hair, teeth chipped in
My shit bump, in the courtroom drunk
Links truck, rocky bracelet, cognac kernel, never chase it
Rap hero, black DeNiro
Federal Bureau tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro, diamond Role, hustling low
Pro-file white gold style, raking bloody dough by the pile
Shot down, still alive, he struggling for the phone, fo-fo blow him
When homicide comes, these three words are sung

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming

Check this out, it's Nasty Nas and Dr. Dre
East meets West
That's how we making it happen
That's how it goes down for the nine-six
Ayo Nas, let's get this money, let's get paid
Sit back and watch all these motherfucking clowns out here
Riffing and beefing about this bullshit
Yo, while they doing all that
We just gon' kick back with these honeys
This Cristal and party to the year 2G

Word, time to take Affirmative Action, son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean?
Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
Niggas don't understand the four devils:
Lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man
[Verse 1: AZ]
Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact, sip your con-gi-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break
Undress 'em, tie 'em with tape — no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone
Or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
Aristocrats, politickin' daily wit' diplomats
See, me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

[Verse 2: Cormega]
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
A nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on a ki of heroin
They found his head on the couch wit' his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out!
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up
Bring your heater, all your C.R.E.A.M. go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill wit' niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream, and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
'Mega — the pretty boy with Mafia connections
It's The Firm, nigga, set it!
[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just' wake
It's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate
And now the projects is talkin' that somebody-gotta-die shit
It's logic — as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice, so Hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars, meetin' Foxy at Demars, movin' cars
Your top papi Señor Escobar

[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
In the black Camaro, Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In a Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E-Moneybags got Moët Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm, baby!
From BK to The 'Bridge, my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Cristy
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uh!
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods — they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait, it's half-and-half
Ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
Double it, times three
We got 48, which mean a whole lot of C.R.E.A.M
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight, we back to 16
Now add the other two that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki, then that's more for me
Mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that — times three
We got three quarters of another ki

My mind's set, son got wet, I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggas actin' illy? Word to Will, he 'bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt with it
Them niggas sour, they put to much flour in they coke
And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY BROKE
While we was gleamin', niggas was schemin'
Seen the ill Bimmers beamin'
Triple-beam and doublin' cream had 'em fiendin'
To get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa
""Sosa, these niggas hit the God, bring the toaster
Meet me in the 'Bridge, I'm bout to go loca""
Left my rat beggin' me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
With two MACs inside the Volvo
What up, God? I'm still sober
I need some Henn' to bend me over
My nigga Hav' gotta soldier
It's gettin' down, it's goin' down, kid (I got this, I got this)
I heard he might not live, I'm holdin' back tears
Told these broads to put it in gear
With two females that don't smile, diggin' they style, yo
What up, son? These niggas done started somethin' wild
You know the clique well, Rhamel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name, holdin' the steel
I paid attention to the females
Maintained bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel
Spray shots and reload and still handle the wheel
Point 'em out, smoke a Phill' then chill
I laid back — Escobar status
Knowin' The Firm got it cornered, we on it
Shit we was born wit'

Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up

Hold it right there, pull over
That nigga right there inside the Rover
I knew he'd be right here, I told you
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rockin' boulders
He's stuntin', after he left my man like that
Without a fair chance to fight back, but I'll be right back
He never seen us, Sos' gave the MAC to Venus
And Vicious, lookin' delicious, handle yo' business
And step to him, shake your ass, try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight Parasuco with young faces
Can turn niggas Buttafuoco of all ages
They was amused by the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls had sprayed New York
If they had to, heard him ask Venus, ""Could I have you?""
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him ""Don't grab, boo""
(What up, boo? What up? What up? What up?)
They started chattin', was only 'bout a minute, flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin'
We followed him pollyin', he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably when they hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and 'em
We laid low about a hour or so, these bitches movin' too slow
We both holdin', what if them wild hoes started foldin'?
Sosa said ""Say no more"", we started rollin'
Before we got in, they must have shot him
Security wildin', there the girls go, hurry up, we out in

Listen.. to reason
Pretty baby, baby, listen

[Verse 1: Nas & (JoJo Hailey)]
A young, wild, beautiful love child
You like 'em thug style, link rocking, then mink copping
Hit you on the sink, a hundred dollar drink popping
The head'll make you take 'em shopping, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel, looking real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (So fine..)
To see ya prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishing I could be the one man
But you juggle way too many willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, getting rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear, get your fuck on
Following week, you back there, but what you stuck on?
Weed, clowns and cars
Puffing with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave
What up, ma? Fronting like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo, it should be a throne for us
But for now, that's a whole different zone from us, word!
[Chorus: Nas & (JoJo Hailey)]
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (Trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (Messing with my mind)
(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)

[Verse 2: Nas & (JoJo Hailey)]
Like Isis, he got your heart broke and felt lifeless
Grow up, girl, instead, you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever getting down and trifless
To get his mind, all you do is give him something priceless
'Cause in time, he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed
(Deceit, yeeeahhh)
There you go again, starting wars, making me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours
Face glistening, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturing you
Igloos of ice tricking on you
You never listen to this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past, though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You getting interviewed, but your boss is into getting screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Coming home wanting more from a college degree, uh
[Chorus: Nas & (JoJo Hailey)]
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (Trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (Messing with my mind)
(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)

[Verse 3: Nas & (JoJo Hailey)]
Where are you focused? On legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo, you seem hopeless
Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to
More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you
You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to
Drop 'em off, letting some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost
(You should be ashamed)
Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you being lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers
Damn, look, there goes a black girl lost

[Outro: JoJo Hailey]
You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doing silly things that is wrong

I'm sayin', man, it's about time, man
These niggas are shoutin' at everythin', you know what I'm sayin'?
Them niggas is gettin' my money, yo!
Them niggas is gettin' MY money, yo!
Yo, fuck that, man, I'mma get that nigga, yo
[Verse 1]
It was a murder
Jake just hit the corner, people swarmin'
Three in the mornin', I jumped out my cab like ""Fuck!""
Niggas is buck, mega bloodshed, the tape's red
I heard some bird whisper, ""Yo, he should've ducked""
I puffed the lila, just before I hit the scene for real-er
I'm all high, it's late, I'm lookin' down at the fella
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His moms had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kinda took it as a brief reminder
That the street's designed to stop ya life clock, the beast'll time ya
Cell to cell, suspect-ass nigga, you fail
First time locked in Comstock, my mind blocks the frail
Burstin', blastin' at you, forty cal' shells split your dry cell
My niggas never snitch, why tell?
We roll wit' no regrets, destinies, fifties and equities
Queens'll be the death of me!

[Chorus]
To the suspect witness — don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect witness — don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)
Suspect witness — don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect witness — don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)
[Verse 2]
Dear God, I want the riches
Money hungry bitches infested
Givin' the jealous niggas sickness to witness
My crew dresses in vests-es, feel the essence
Try to test this scientist, able and reckless
Slaughter, Nautica down, frames look petite
Ten millies, minks designed just for my physique
I keep a low pro' as if I owe, bless the flow lovely
My pants hang while I'm dancin', sippin' the bubbly
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Rollin' two Phillies together make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of
Early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker's psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Tan Clarks, Armani in small print upon my glasses
Don assassins, Armageddon
The weddin' of a freak and a beat
Seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'
Comprehend the grammar, math we own
Are you the type of nigga to shoot a leg to get your name known?
I flip the brain tone, niggas get hit and wrapped in plastic
The mic I strike in vain, givin' the pain of what a MAC is
What you wit'? Lucci or drama?
No sleep means insomnia
No need to check the clock, the streets'll time ya
[Chorus]
Suspect witness — don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect witness — don't come outside

It justifies, Nas Escobar's leavin' shit mesmerized
Mega live like the third world
Decipher my deceiver, make him a believer
Spittin' Gem Stars words in my mic type receiver
Bond is my life, so I live by my word
Never fraudulent, Queensbridge don't make no herbs
Spread my name to deacons, politicians while they speakin'
Rebel to America civilization, caught you sleepin'

[Verse 1]
Yo, release what's in me
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans, it's crack, 200 grams
I pump a G-pack, peepin' for where the D's at
It's slow, lookin' for Rambo
The cop who got grazed back in the days
Chasin' niggas through my project maze
That cop — he got a death wish
He run behind niggas until you breathless
Everyday, he makin' ten arrests, shit!
My nigga, check this, I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten, inspect it
(Already checked it, dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
To check Tanisha, fat ass, real fly with the blonde caesar
Vittadini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
A Irish man, short, slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba
She due, be lookin' weaker, now her teeth are foul
Speakin' loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolvin', like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin'
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
'Cause she's a nympho, suckin' dick and coughin' up info
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up
I know he's vest up, we blazin' from the neck up
(Yo, let me knock first) Soon as he open, let your Glock burst
They had the chains on, son, hit the lock first
We busted in, the cop jerked, Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders and the monitors
They eyein' us, (Nas, yo, he survived one from the fo'-five)
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down
A-yo, the bitch is saved now
She's livin' in a snitch grave now
[Chorus]
Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face-to-face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God, just save the life that the Devil sold
See, It Was Written, but was never told
Peep the jewels, black man, it's even better than gold
Niggas roll with iron
Police roll in hot pursuit, tryin' to stop the loot
Fuck Jake, cock and shoot

[Verse 2]
Still on the streets with my peeps so deep
We threw a block party for my man goin' up creek
To do his two-to-four, niggas show love from all around the board
Peace, Lord, Sony Handy-Cam on record
Pop a bottle, 'cause when you come home, we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape, play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
Barbecued wings, we fed the fiends
(Gamble in the back!) Killa shouted
And Frank tried to stop the bank, lost about what a Roley cost
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off
He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own The Hill
Couldn't take losin' his cash, and I could feel
Something in the air, yeah
Frank returned with Pierre
A gunslinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holdin', 'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reachin'
They had gats in each others faces
With kids and grandmothers around
Frank's only concern was his papers
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggas jet off
Police blitz quick, waitin' for that to set off
Runnin' the static, it got me mad 'cause they a bunch of faggots
Startin' shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo, High, get the 40-Cali stainless
Jake is still out, let's make it real and still make 'em niggas famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearin' Jake retaliatin', and Wiz was up the alley waitin'
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died
Internal bleedin' inside, and ain't been back since '95

For niggas don't know how to act (No doubt, son)
Fresh out the  motherfuckin' pack (No doubt, son)
For niggas don't know how to act
[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo, NYC, U-N-I-verse, seriously
Havoc and P — Queens niggas, so it seem to be
Monopolize, strategies of war, exercise
Mega got word back from Noreaga
The D.A. got video cassette tape of
The god with the God-U-Now, pullin' a caper
Runnin' up in the spot, mask and duct taped up
Pig-tie they motherfuckin' wrists to they ankles
I been through, crime shit my niggas into
Peep the issue, situation like this, we stickin' him too
JFK on our way to L.A
Got links with big cats down in Santa Barbré
My crew do it the Mobb way, every day
Crime pay, who wanna gunplay? Thrill me
Niggas kill me, grillin' me, you wanna look? Peep the nine milli
Now undress, you know the drill-y
Niggas suspect, weak links pose threats
I have yet to met challenger who go against my set
Gemstars razor sharp like Gillette
Shavin' closely on any character approach me
I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny
While cat burg-lars tryna sneak-peek the recipe
Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet
You pay about $5,000 a plate
[Verse 2: Havoc & Prodigy]
No doubt, kid, I hit them niggas like a bid
The prosecutor, runnin' up in your crib
Do your dirt, I do my dirt all by my lonely
It's only me, and the gat that's holdin' me
We got it locked beyond measure, your clique's under pressure
Extort you for your treasure, smack you with the undresser
Represent your clique, go ahead, get that ass whipped
Floatin' in a river wit' your body wrapped in plastic
Wannabe thug get smacked for back talkin'
QB represent, fuck that, it can happen
While you rappin', I'm busy tryna sneak the gat in
Contamin', cut the party short while you jammin'
We think smarter, reach harder
Got the .44, bodyguard of somethin' you don't want a part of
If I was you, then I would do what I have to
But you ain't me, you hesitated so I clapped you
Then stepped off casually, naturally me

[Verse 3: Nas]
Niggas thinkin' shit's sweet, I carry big heat
Wavy hair, chipped teeth
Up in this bitch deep
Queens murder cliques meet
Yellow tape on black gates
Mediterranean, projects is like Kuwait
I escape into zones that's irregular
Why debate on a phone? I'm solar cellular
Escobar 600
You just a crumb inside a world where the rich run it
Curriculum of a mathologist
Deep throats, they try to swallow this, anthropologists
Dynasties of great knowledgists I preserve in my dome
Niggas' mics is full of silicone, spot's blown
Guerilla ice on this killer's life, I put my word on it
Now, you can sleep on or rock a swerve on it
Nas is ménage à trois on Mount Airy Lodges
We like a smooth fam, but rougher than how DeBarge is
Catchin' charges of marksmen, livin' heartless
Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit
We mobbin', puttin' niggas in mausoleums
From Queens 'cross to Throgs Neck, heads bop, I see 'em!

14.0,If I Ruled the World (Imagine That),It Was Written,1996,"If I Ruled the World (Imagine That) Lyrics[Produced by Rashad Smith & Trackmasters]

[Intro: Nas]
Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know
[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be: Paradise life, relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

[Verse 3: Nas]
You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felony
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons,I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em, love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

I never wanted to see your face again

I was back on fire

Made a picture of you in my mind
My love is eating me
I want you by my side

10.0,Sing About Love,The Album,1993,"Sing About Love LyricsEverybody's gotta gotta have love
Everybody's gotta gotta have love
Everybdoy's gotta gotta have love
Cause this feeling is in us and it starts above
Put on your shoes, gotta get in the race
Cause the way that we're going is a really sad pace
Pick up the mick, hold it in your hand
It's cold, it's bold, might think you're a man
Listen to the words we don't even understand
I'm not a preacher, nor a selling man
It's a product at end now to you understand
Big approach you wanna kill you man?
Leave the truth, don't try to kill each other
White or black, he's got to be your brother
Day and night, you've got to have a look
Before he goes you just have to take it
I've been told that things just last forever
Form the top of the sky to the bottom of the water
Isn't true you lost your brother?
Don't try to hide this feeling you have inside
Cause we all see your mood

How do we sing about love?
Everybody's gotta gotta have love
Cause this feeling is in all of us and it starts above
How do we sing about love?
How do we sing about love?

Everybody's gotta gotta have love
Everybody's gotta gotta have love
Everybdoy's gotta gotta have love
Cause this feeling is in us and it starts above

Days like mine seen in the world all over
Although you say you know me I'll bet you never will
A track that you follow, a possible give in
We can save the world
We can save the world

How do we sing about love?
Everybody's gotta gotta have love
Cause this feeling is in all of us and it starts above
How do we sing about love?
How do we sing about love?
Everybody's gotta gotta have love
Everybody's gotta gotta have love
Everybdoy's gotta gotta have love
Cause this feeling is in us and it starts above

God was talking to us through words
But he never told man how it would go
First came light, then tv
Another day later, lots of babies
Look at the colour, what do you see?
White, black, green; it don't matter to me
Ring, ring down talking to the phone
Somebody's taking your life; nobody's home
Look at the colour, what do you see?
White, black, green; it don't matter to me
Ring, ring down talking to the phone
Somebody's taking your life; nobody's home

How do we sing about love?
Everybody's gotta gotta have love
Cause this feeling is in all of us and it starts above
How do we sing about love?

11.0,I Miss You,The Album,1993,"I Miss You Lyrics[Intro]
[ I know if you could hear me you would
Say there are always two sides of a story
You're so right, here's mine
I cannot live without you ]

[Verse 1]
Love was never easy
But leaving you was hard
And time didn't heal my wounds at all
I wonder, if you know what I'm going through
All the lonely times that we're apart
[Chorus]
I miss you, oh I miss you
I'm gonna need you more and more each day
I miss you, more than words can say
More than words can ever say

[Verse 2]
Saying sorry was a question of my pride
Pride can push aside a loving heart
In the end emotion has ruled my mind
And I'm asking for a second start

[Chorus]

[ Maybe I've said words that really didn't
Mean, but I know, every day
When a man does wrong
I know I miss you ]

Uhh.. yo
Whattup? Whattup?
It's time man (word, it's time?)
Straight up (it's time, man)
Aight, set that shit off (set it off then, nigga)
Set it off (set if off)

[Verse 1]
Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
Neighbors look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock, momma should've cuffed me to the radiator
Why not? It might've saved me later from my block
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin' off the stroll, coughin'
Stitches in they head, stinkin' and I dread thinkin' they be snitchin'
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the dark—NARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starve—they bust a U-ey, I jog
To my building—come out later wearin' camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain—strangle men
Niggas gaspin' for air 'til they move no more and just stare
With dead eyes—tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sisters pregnant
Fathers on drugs, moms is smokin', beds is piss-infested
Had 8 partners growin' up, 8 turned to 7
7 turned to 6 niggas, got 2 in heaven
6 of us holdin' it, now it's 5 rollin' thick
The 6th one's parole flipped, 5 niggas went to 4 quick
When he went O.T., college life
Converted into gangbangin', 4 niggas still hangin'
Years passin' and slang changin'—3 of us now, 4th nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real—he did the snake shit
Fake shit—beat his ass down
Yo his mouth could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin' clown
All I got left in the end is 2 of my best friends
And we all goin' out to the death for these ends
What?
[Chorus (repeats in bridge)]
New York, New York (New York state of mind)
New York, New York (New York state of mind)

[Bridge]
You heard about it, you see about it
You read about it, it's in your papers
It's in your daily news (""Get money!"")
New York chronicles, every day
The crime rate, the murder rate
The money rate, the paper chase (aight?)
You know what I mean?
New York state of mind, baby (oh, yeah)
Check it out (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm at the gamblin' spot, my hands on a knot
New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot
I take a nigga dough, send him home to a shoebox
You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox
Hear my favorite song, all these niggas sing along
All the cigarette smoke's cloggin' my lungs
Hoodrats flashin' they tongue
Young thugs blastin' they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggas both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggas got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on whoever walk in or leave
'Cause I ain't playin', niggas'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggas'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggas, just New York niggas
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin' with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on 'em, you knew 'em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggas is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid
Faggot-ass niggas that be scared to do they bids
Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggas, that relocated down South
Comin' back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s
Runnin' round quick to split your mug, it's easy
To score but it's hard to get the shit off
Niggas fightin' over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggas mad 'cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver
A lot of niggas schemin', some real, some niggas frontin'
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin'

3.0,Hate Me Now,I Am...,1999,"Hate Me Now Lyrics[Produced by D Moet, Pretty Boy & Trackmasters]

[Intro: Nas and Puff Daddy]
Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me? Let's go

[Chorus 1: Puff Daddy and Nas]
You can hate me now, (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now
[Ad-lib over Chorus: Puff Daddy (Nas)]
Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
Weak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now)
Fuck y'all!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest
[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
Money is power, motherfucker!
I got millions of thugs on salary

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (Cmon)
You can hate me now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now

[Ad-Libs: Nas and Puff Daddy]
Do it now! I told you, do it now!
Let's go

[Verse 2: Nas]
You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': ""That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with.""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same OG
People warned me: ""When you're on top there's envy""
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, hoe?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?
[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
I like this, I like the way this feels

[Verse 3: Nas]
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Jamming up the border to this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just inferior man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Outro: Puff Daddy and Nas]
You can hate me now, (C'mon, niggas!)
But I won't stop now (Do it now! Get this shit over with!)
It ain't gon' never stop, niggas!41Embed"
4.0,Small World,I Am...,1999,"Small World Lyrics[Produced by  Carlos ""6 July"" Broady & Nashiem Myrick]

[Intro]
See no evil, fear no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil
If you don't bring that shit around you
You ain't got nothing to worry about (uh-huh)
Yeah (yeah, uh-huh)
Know what I'm saying?
Yo, yo yo yo

[Verse 1]
Carolyn from Maryland, she Lady Heroin
She elegant, her apparel in the M-Class caravan
Keys of dope, loving cats to ski in her throat
She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat
Her ice fro, ass is curvy, 40 years old
She passing for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's
Madison Ave., shopping when she not, copping bricks of that shit
She hopping on dicks, riding Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually bumped into her shopping for jewellery
Her bodyguard screwing me, I gave her my math
Ain't nothing new to me, blowing backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look with a bow-leg
Yo niggas said, ""Shorty's a pro, she blow heads
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her""
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck
She knew about cats from way back, we smoke the haystack
She never coughed once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, '96 he tried to rob me
I jetted though, sometimes you never know
He snorted all her work, now she need me to do her dirty work
[Chorus]
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world..""), you get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (""It's a.. small world.."")

[Verse 2]
Snook from Red Hook was grimy, did 5 years, glad to be home
From Attica, known for keeping chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it
5 years planning to blow soon as he hit the bridicks
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month and deaded his P.O
Started robbing niggas ‘til he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starving niggas he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, ""Don't knock hard""
Laying with his bitch, 'niggas is rich' is what he told her
Played the block, holding cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, 6 shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossing fast
His old man had crossed his ass for the laws of this fast cash
[Chorus]
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world..""), you get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (""It's a.. small world.."")

[Verse 3]
I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why
We let the slugs fly, enter your brain through your skull
Another thug died, pitching your soul into that infinite
Black hole where many souls go cause of a .44 blast
Snook was one of ‘em, so many more
Even that Fendi whore got niggas hit up, yeah let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dope fiend OD'd, '85
He went crazy, stuck up banks to stay alive
He was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried
Robbed armored trucks, incidents where police died
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God, he stared at me hard
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit 'em
I'm reaching for my Roscoe, cocked it back on
And get my blast on, at the gas station, bunch of Arabs racing
Out the way as my Taurus spray
Jump in the whip, hit the highway
You know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
But can't figure out whose who, keep it true
Shit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never
'Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this cheddar
[Chorus]
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world..""), you get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (""It's a.. small world.."")

Fuckin' with us, that get you motherfuckers touched
Hit in the darkest alleys, where the Super Sports rally
Beatin' up the block, leavin' these motherfuckers shot
They ain't ready for the Nakamici

They try to breeze me, but I got niggas in New York
Comin' kama-kize, sparkin' this shit that keep me off the heezee

To scoop me, blowin' dukey, in the black Range Rover

Tell these niggas why we here

Nuttin' but the New York to Texas connection
Nuttin' but some real shit, what y'all expected
Spaz out, some times dreamin', think I'm awoke
Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me
That's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me
I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain

Where his brother go to school at? Find out some more information
Bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back
Cause when it come down to the come down;

Walk up to his face and then gone
Set a example, send these hoes a little message:
They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it
Leaded, I pull these capers all the time
With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherfuckin' mind
Him and whoever standin' by, I'll tell these niggas, ""Let's go""
And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die

Attack 'em like Freddy, then we toastin' over spaghetti

Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger
With a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga
Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw

6.0,We Will Survive,I Am...,1999,"We Will Survive Lyrics[Intro: Kenny Loggins sample]
Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

[Break]
To my dogs.. wherever you are

[Verse 1]
Whattup Big? You know shit is rough after you slid
You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid
Ain't nuttin' changed, still Party and Bullshit
We used to fuck R&B Bitches and see who rhyme sickest
For every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out
Machine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts
You came to my hood, we was broke
I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?
Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so
'Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto
But fuck it black, you livin' your life, through your loved ones
Peace to your daughter and your newborn son
It used to be fun, makin' records to see your response
But, now competition is none, now that you're gone
And these niggas is wrong, using your name in vain
And they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that
It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you
Joke with you, happy we on top, the most official
Ain't too many real ones out there, I feel some but doubt they're
Capable to take it where you took it to
I missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake
'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way
I woulda stayed so long with so much to say
I had to put it in writin' to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin'
Tellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side
But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by
You can't kill nothin' that's Ready to Die
You was like God to us in the form of Allah
[Kenny Loggins sample]
Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

[Chorus]
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

[Verse 2]
(Thug Life never die..)
Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop
And use teeth to bite off beer tops and Pour Out a Lil' Liquor
You was more than just the wildest nigga
2Pacalypse, I understand your style, nigga
It's goin on the third year, since you've been gone
On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on
The industry be talkin', offendin' me often
They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin
I can relate, shootouts and court dates
All Eyez on You, niggas in your face invadin' your space
You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?
How long would I ride before I fold up?
How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?
You predicted it in every line, all in your flow
There could Never Be Peace I have to quote
Can't believe I heard my name on ""the realest shit you ever wrote""
We had words 'cause the best supposed to clash at the top
But kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped
In NYC, at MTV, people watched
We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep
Think about how us real niggas would be
If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?
You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified
Like the son of God, when Lucifer lied
And make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?
But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link
Will there ever be another MC as nice?
Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?
[Kenny Loggins sample]
Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

[Chorus]
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

[Verse 3]
I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?
Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?
What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?
Was it the drugs, put an end to the music business?
If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down
A plan and pursue my dream, turn my life around
'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream
I'll need a extra Uzi ridin' through my own hood in Queens
It be the ones you always knew, that want it on
Tellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on
Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty
Not used to walkin' in the path of legit money
I thought I made it but we only took baby steps
Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks
To my clicks when I got it I said ""Baby bless""
That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess
We in the 90's and finally it's lookin' good
Hip-Hop took it to billions, I knew we would
A lot of ups and downs in the game
Could lose or gain a couple pounds tryin' to maintain
One day you here, the next you not; when you around niggas, check 'em out
Some is 'bout it, most individuals plots
And run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves
While others have no cares and stay in jail
More than 50% of us endin' up with holes through the chest
Through the head, through the gut it shows
The future for us young shooters and old killers
Who become rich as dope dealers?
Nothin' left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments
Thug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap
We want the fast way out of this trap
Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin' crack
To my deceased Gods wishin' I could bring you back
But life is a dream and y'all taught me that
[Kenny Loggins sample]
.. always survive.. but why?

[Outro]
Always survive, always
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my niggas just stay alive6Embed"

Uhh
Regulate, nigga
Bravehearts, nigga
Live for this
Some of y'all don't live at all
Get yours, nigga
Get yours, baby
Uhh, yo
Yo
[Verse 1]
As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
With big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
From Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S
About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin' words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
But hold before you one of those prophetic MCs
With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin', from past to present times, heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise

[Chorus]
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..
[Verse 2]
Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men - not takin' charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it
Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad

[Chorus]
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..
[Verse 3]
You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I sold lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin' but takin'
Headed for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin'
Judges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin' where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin' man's past
And a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin' harder than the generations here before he came
Goin' through the same bullshit as our fathers
Readin' history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter
Ghetto prisoners.. ghetto prisoners..

Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise

I'm never free always on the move, business oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit trying
Before you find what you looking for and get to crying
You always saying what you gon' do if you catch me lying

You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doing his thang?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up

Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely

Hell yeah
Check it check it check, check check
Yo, when it come to sex advice, I'm the one to call
If you a virgin with blue balls or you tear down walls
Not Dr. Ruth, call me Dr. Knockboot
Pimped out hats, rock fashionable suits
A class for the youth, Sex Ed for your head
The do's and don'ts, that should happen in the bed
First, DON'T: run up in her raw cause you get burned
For sure, fuckin' with the typical whore, because
DO: rock a Rough Ryder, whenever you inside her
Your local bodega is your supplier
And DON'T: take the pussy, if she fightin'
Cause you saw what happened to 2Pac and Mike Tyson
'Specially if you large, some hoes is trife
Get you on a rape charge, have you servin' your life
Yo, DO: get a yes confirmation before penetration
You wind up in a police station
DON'T: get with no young bitch and hit it
She PG-13, you rated R, she not permitted
DO: check for ID, whenever chillin' V.I.P
With fly shorty P.Y.T
Yo, DON'T: lie about the cars you got
Or who you hang with, frontin' when you borrowed your watch
Yo, DO: play your game right, if the G's tight
Then you can fuck shorty the same night
Yo, DON'T: trick when you don't have to
You think you ballin'? You turn your back they laughin' at you
You don't gotta keep repeatin you a thug, she heard you
In fact, she attracted to your man that herbed you
DO: spend a lil' dough, only if you know
The bitch gross a lil' somethin' too bro
DON'T: eat the pussy the first night
Maker her bless you, we call that shit gesundheit
DO: set the mood right, Bailey's with ice
A cup of Thug Passion'll make everything right
Yo, DON'T: pop shit like you Daddy Longdick
When you come fast like Fed-Ex and bust too quick
DO: hit positions she will find interest in
DON'T: hit the pussy if that shit's blisterin'
Hope you're listenin', turn up your transisterin'
Hot 97, KISS-FM or B-L-S, with your hand up her dress
Chillin' with your girl while you thinkin' 'bout ya ex
Not too easy not too complex

Problems or questions, I can answer them best
Signin' off Dr. Knockboot at your request, peace

Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that I wrote niggas
Lots of my mans trapped up in a max
Penitentiary, sending me letters I answer back
That eventually, we all be Bentley'ed out
Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats, Jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, strapped, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life
I can say I did the right thing

Cause you played it sweet now you floating in the harbor (for real)
Shit is hectic so respect it for your health (what)
Didn't think it was right, you should've checked it yourself (come on)
Life is too short to get caught up in some dumb shit
Wake up one day, 40 years old on some bum shit
Time flew by, you was too fly to see the light
Everyday it's getting darker then comes the night
Now what? (what) Realize that you ain't got shit (uh)
Not long ago you was the man on some hot shit
So just peep the flow yo, 'cause you already in this
Make sure your shit is right kid and handle your business (uh huh)

Except the dollars other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)

Low and behold the young, black, and powerful
Got to eat yo, everyday my daughter feet grow
You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow
Paying doctors when I'm born, a preacher if I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a bid'ness
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life diminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit
Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best
Prepare for the worst, no fears no nothing on earth
No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first
Nor the last, nigga, let's get this cash, nigga

Get yours nigga
'Cause I'ma get mine

Everybody gotta shine
Get yours, I spray nines
I say this one time
The last time, I swear to y'all
I'm from where
The dope fiends is at
And killers crawl
And snitches call police
On these niggas, and street
Corners everybody's like
Smokin' marijuana and
Snuffin' niggas in faces and startin' drama and
Shootin' niggas, cold blood, just kill 'em, so what
With the fo' pound go nuts
Better slow up
Before you get your ass sewn up
Nigga never gon' grow up
Drinkin' the Henny
But he know he gon' throw up
Tryin' to make crack sales
What it look like? Future for a black male
Don't want to make my momma cry
On a front page for a homicide
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive
Where chicks get blunted and ride
Do 105 in the fast lane
And a fast pace, chasin' the papes
Spendin' chips on big chains
And the dimes that give brains
That was a 80's and 90's thing
Now I'm into big things
[Chorus]
Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you
Now I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't do that shit no more
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you

Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners
I'm into big things
Tired of talkin' small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things

When I started this
All I wanted was cars and cribs
Like other rap artists but
Do I know where I'm goin' to?
Can I forget when I came from?
I be showin' you
Another style I'ma flow for you
Can I make somethin' wild
I can throw for you, flow for you
Make it bi-coastal
Take it to heights
That some of y'all can't come close to?
Some of y'all
Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when y'all niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I stop and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I rap and y'all stop and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga, now
Rocks that glisten
Can't stop my mission
Make another LP drop
I'm hittin' with the new shit, exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime
I ain't have shit to do with
Used to chase the hoes
Now I chase the dough
Is y'all bitches gonna help me get paper?
No!

Gotta get my life together man (uh huh)

Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you (why?)
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners (why's that?)
I'm into big things (uh)
Tired of talkin' small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things

[Verse 3]
I go past y'all (UH-HUH)
Y'all got the glass jaw (UH-HUH)
And when I hit it, admit it
Y'all on ya ass y'all (UH-HUH)
We on the same team
You don't wanna pass the ball
Chuck and gunnin' for dough
You want to score
But you really don't know how to to ball
I put you on
It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast, now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out?
Where ya clique now?
Where you sit now? In the back seat
Mad 'cause I flip styles and I pack heat
Make you run laps like a pro athlete
And I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
I'ma tell you what's real
And what could stop you from makin a mil'
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high with you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
'Cause they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'?
Not forever
At least to 140
Pray for me, I'm tryin' to eat
Like the niggas who bought
Motown off Berry Gordy
Good God
[Chorus]
Nigga I'm tired of games
I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Tired of talkin' small talk
'Cause now I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
Man we already did that
Now I'm into big things
No time to get sidetracked
Now I'm into big things
Get money now besides that
Some more big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things3Embed"
13.0,Nas Is Like,I Am...,1999,"Nas Is Like Lyrics[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Intro]
(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like; Nas is like; Nas is like)
Umm, Premo, Nas
Yeah, yeah, yo
(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like)
[Verse 1]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murdered—the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10s to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking it light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course, N-A-S are the letters that spell (Nas, Nas, Nas)
[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel (Uh, uh)
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 2]
(Nas is like) Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
(Nas is like) Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death, the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blasting TECs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is
[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (C'mon)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 3]
(Nas is like) Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies
I'm like all races combined in one man, like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces and none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in ya system every night, now
[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt (Uh); Nas is like92Embed"

[Verse 1]
She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this
Showed me how exciting life is
I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks
The sheistiest, put you on they heist list
How we met, must've been fate
First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raise kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day
I can get with that I drop you off home
I call you hit me back
I wanna dig that and did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids at
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats
You precious, more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact I'm kinda hoping we can stay together, word

[Verse 2]
I see you dressed up in white face covered in veil
Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwing rice
And it's the day that your father give you away
To a real man that gently put the ring on your hand
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now, look me in my eyes and say I do
Driving off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the States
You can throw your friend the bouquet
Something in the back of my head say
Why us two? Maybe 'cause I love you
Hug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you
As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you
Won't stop 'til I tell you me to, beautiful
Deeper and harder love laying new with you
Running my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by
While I'm with you and I won't even care, word

I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G
[Verse 3]
She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's
Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas
Thug ones to those soft as baby shit
She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips
'Til one day she decided to flip
It was nutting I can do about it, like she the boss and shit
Started talking this divorcing shit
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake
Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look
With a fine-ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too
You my queen, God bless you

15.0,Money Is My Bitch,I Am...,1999,"Money Is My Bitch Lyrics[Intro]
{*Kissing*}
I love you so much, don't ever leave me, I won't let you leave

[Verse 1]
The hoe turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love with her
I saved that hoe 'cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heartbroken, she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna lose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jig, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her cream I lust, now I got her I don't know how to act
When she not around, I'm heated, 'bout to lay something flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped
[Chorus]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey

Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

[Verse 2]
All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket
It's so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private
You got me karats on my wrist
I'm a savage for your kiss
Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard
Niggas always expect to see us two together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup
'Cause when we hump we do it up
Make sure we both will bust a dollar sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slinging all night long, fiending to stroke ya
Seeing niggas with you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note
[Chorus]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped

Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

[Verse 3]
I won't sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you?
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you, before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me cause I'm with you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
It's hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat with government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I liked you better when you were illegal
But you had to get professional, musical
Now when we fuck we use prophylactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxury, when I asked it
Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya assets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees
[Chorus]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey

Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped

16.0,Undying Love,I Am...,1999,"Undying Love Lyrics[Produced by L.E.S]

[Verse 1]
Uh...
Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
At The Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin' cigars, couples and stars
Flashin' cameras, dealers, shufflin' cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the .45
'Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin', duckin', our bitches in the club cluckin'
Tellin' my wife who I was dancin' with like I was fuckin'
Flew back, Monday evenin'
From Nevada where the sun was beamin'
To the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin'
Told my dogs ""Peace"", kept it movin', I was beat when
Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no, that's down low
My baby's drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around, yo
To the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin' her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin' swingin' on the ceiling fan, I stopped it
Swingin' slower and slower
On the last swing, I saw it was a G-string and heard laughter
Thought about my nine-side Glock
But somethin' made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack
Seen wifey layin' with some nigga mumblin' shit
He had one hand on her ass, and she was rubbin' his dick
Toastin' wine glasses, cherry scented candles was lit
Couldn't handle the shit
Searchin' for words — I found none
Without a sound, I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin', whylin', what I'm gon' do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through
[Chorus x2]
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face, was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
""Son, you home early — they wiped you out that quick?""
I said, ""Nah,"" showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, ""Bet you'll never guess in a million years
What I just saw happenin' — and probably still is
Snuck in my crib, some nigga fuckin' my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me""
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
20G's on a ring I would've hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front, when I talked he had jumped
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock — Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin' out like kamikaze
We surrounded, red lights flashin', who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin' suicide
Horse asked me for the MAC, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots, couldn't tell what was goin' on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin'
Put it on her ring finger, cocked the Glock and started prayin'
To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin'
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
This'd be my fate, such a grotesque murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said ""Amen""
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer
Held her close, squeeze the toast
Said to her, ""Now unto God, we elope... we elope""

What's happening brothers and sisters?
Welcome to our time

[Jessica Care Moore]
Afro-Angels hide my weapons in tangles
Black Star Spangled, fragile like hematite with the East oils I write
Despite the lack of sunlight, got my battle boots tight
Now that the government's gone, can't tell your left from your right
Winged assassins laughin while the New World's collapsing
Mother Earth's ribs crashed in, armed with cowries, I'm blasting
As the Earth rebels my womb swells
The birth of Black Magic, savin my people force of habit
You can't find if you ain't never had it
Spiritually crafted black-listed hair-twisted ghetto embargo lifted
Power-shifting comb-fisting I predict Goddesses you running after witches
I kiss my fourteen stitches
Keep all my baby girl wishes
I predict all the oceans turn dry
Not one baby girl will cry as you attempt to grow broccoli from the desert
We will take our pregnant bodies, drink from underground rivers
Wash your face between our legs
While recreating humanity, we will summon yemanja
Search for our fertility, ban all pink and yellow pills
Ban all pink and yellow pills
I predict killing fields of ghetto armpatch anti-Hatch
Hate groups will be bombed
Childbirth becomes outlawed
Always will be branded numbered and logged
All paper money is gone
Confused scholars can't interpret our scrolls
Your sky has holes
We know the young is old
Nastradamus tell us how the story gets told3Embed"

Let's hold it down though, y'know?
However it's gon' go down
This what we gotta deal with, y'know?
Yo..

[Chorus]
It's the life we chose (uhh), where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know (uhh)
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
(But yo..) this life is the only life I know...
[Verse 1]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Gold bathtubs, making love to my Queen
Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rolling up green
Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall
My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine
Closets, full of rockets and sub-machines
Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team
Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides
Mr. Chow both coasts with the most loud toast
Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dying
'Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealing with science
My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it
They never know we enemies until they hear me say it
Til they kid's on the phone saying, ""Please daddy pay it""
Til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement
High-class elegance, you respect or you hiss
You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence
It's strategic, how these niggas want you to think
You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep
Why you stink? Yo these streets don't allow you to blink
You get showered by lead, coming out with your mink
Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles
Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico
It's hard fucking with niggas you hope you can trust
You a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck
And you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?
Shit is devious, ex-friends wanting you stuck
[Chorus]
It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
This life is the only life I know...

[Verse 2]
Uhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?
He wanna stick you
What's love, you got beef?
Nobody rolling with you
What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care
Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the ear?
What's real, when you know your man's girl is a ho
And you don't even let him know, 'cause you fucked her befo'
What's real, when you talk behind a man's back
Then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?
What's trust, when they separate your case
When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face
What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?
And he never crossed you, but you claiming he's fam'?
What's trust, when you get bust, your niggas don't retaliate?
They blaze purple haze with 'em the next day?
God forbid one of my niggas get hit, I'ma go haywire
Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire
But everybody's different, you won't know how you react
Til you in that position, and that's an actual fact
The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?
You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you
Who's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90
On your deathbed you regret being grimy
What's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug?
A ghetto child raised around drugs 'til he's old enough to bust slugs?
Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse
When he come home to catch another case?
Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it
You did it, heaven or hell or prison
Who knows when your clock'll stop ticking, get your weight up
Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya
You getting older player, look at those who gave up
[Chorus]
It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it

While you listening to the words that I wrote on the disc

Two G's, we got the type fam with MAC-11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, Piaget watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eye can understand that I'm...

4.0,Some of Us Have Angels,Nastradamus,1999,"Some of Us Have Angels Lyrics[Chorus]
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)

[Verse 1]
Now this is you, dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat
A good nigga, you don't leave tracks
A hood nigga wantin' G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that
You feel you need that, where the juxs at?
These are your niggas, creepin' they be leavin' niggas sleep witchu
Loc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official
Sometime they grimy, speakin' on they own people
They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos
Now these are your bitches, phonin' lonely homie chickens
All the homies stick 'em, you think you own 'em man, listen
She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen
Put a root on you, next week they find you missin'
Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and
Tumbled 'til you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up
Fake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices
Two sides of us, negative and positive
[Chorus]
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)

[Verse 2]
Now this is your mom, your good luck charm
Pushin you to do no wrong, prayin for you that you live long
Nobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy
In and out of jail, mom's screamin', ""God take me!""
This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him
The man of the house, mom and pops separatin'
Spittin' image of a gangsta, the way pop walked
The way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies
Turnin' into the things moms wanted you not to be
Crime followin' the wrong dudes who have no values
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you
This is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of
Niggas around you make threats
They tell you keep it gangsta, no matter the predicament
Even though your decision won't help you benefit
[Chorus]
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)

[Verse 3]
Now once again this is you, entertainin' your desires
Bitches, money and guns, aimin' and you fire
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin' your seed
Tryin' to eat? You form material needs
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off
By stickin' up niggas, make them take they jewels off
His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers
And any chance he get, he can take niggas
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is
When he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me
You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head
And if I let go I'm dead
He stepped at my door, the takes motivate my spirit
An out of body experience, so now I feel it
Lookin' at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me
Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary
I never hate, that's just wasted energy
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?
The future - and time only reveals, what fear is
False expectations, appearin' real
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told
And I will 'til permanently, my eyes are closed
[Chorus]
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)

5.0,Project Windows,Nastradamus,1999,"Project Windows Lyrics[Produced by Trackmasters]

[Verse 1: Nas]
Black hoods, cops and projects, sewers flooded with foul blockage
The gutter's wild and every child watches
Chains in top locks get ripped off hinges
Doors kicked off, drunks stag off Smirnoff, wipe your beard off
Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare, vision blurry
'Cause buried deep in they mind are hidden stories
Bet he's a mirror image of that '70s era
He's finished for the rest of his life, 'til he fades out
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
So many ways out the hood, but no signs say out
Mental slave house where gats go off, I show off
Niggas up north, prison-ology talk, 'til they time cut off
You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought
To hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again
Plan to leave somethin' behind
So your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on
[Chorus: Ron Isley]
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, if this piano's the cake, then my words are the candles
Light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you
Impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo
They lit it up {*puff puff*}, hit it up {*puff*}, now they dismantled
Think the whole world is crazy, got a nine, watch where you walk Two dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York
Hire Satan, United Nations quietly taken, toll on your soul
Take it or leave it, just my evaluation
Stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate
But to stay awake, 'cause the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison
To the gas left on this whole mass, if we don't get it controlled fast
Might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow
Perishin', brain dead from a Ericsson
Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons
A cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune, uhh

[Chorus: Ron Isley]
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
[Verse 3: Nas]
Another day, another dollar, my mother will holla
She said, ""go and see the world for myself, and my brother should follow""
Pops was smooth, from his top to his shoes
Sang the blues, guitar strings he played smokin' his Kool
Duke Ellington hat, picture this yo, seventies cat
He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework
At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out
A fight, people screamin' 'cause somebody pulled a knife out
So I look at this room, I'm hooked to this tune
Every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
But jail was ahead of me, was speedin' like amphetamine
Reading's what I should've done, 'cause my imagination would run
I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds
And I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs
Yo, the hustla's and hoes, drugs and fo'-fo's
This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows

[Chorus: Ron Isley]
Oh, outta my window
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
[Outro: Ron Isley]
Starin' out of, out my window
Oh I, feel so tired
Oh yeah, outta my window
Oh, lookin' out, lookin' out of
Lookin' out my window, oh yeah
Makes me, feel so tired
Lookin' out of my project window

To read his latest poem for us

[Verse 1]
Yo..
Yo.. yo..
Power and crime, the thugs slinging powder and dimes
Twenties of D, is yo' niggas wilder than mine?
My niggas bust nines, puff lye and stick up cowards
For they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers
I'm like Luca Brasi, Vito's best hit-man
That's ""Godfather"" shit, back seat, next lit plans
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with
And you don't want the God to pull up, the cars are sick
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge King
Plaques, awards, applause when I do my thing
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray
With stains of blood and germ and piss all day
Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised
Duck and pray that my guns don't bust your way
Niggas with names, living off reputation
Sometimes gotta remind you ain't nothing changing

If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war, we can take it there
[Verse 2]
You don't like me clown? Now you wanna take me down?
If I bring my face around, you gon' do what? You butt
Your crew knew I blew up, I been shining - baseball diamonds
Dick rings for your chicklings
Niggas know what my nine pearl handle's about
Fuck you say girlie mouth? Get it krunk like the Dirty South
And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i
Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?
Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?
You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me
Who ill as me? I wild on haters in album three
Next level - I take y'all niggas to 3-D
Can't find a nigga shook from Queens
I'll be with the most grimy killers
(what nigga) and they all look clean
Who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start
Your next stop is to the graveyard

[Chorus]
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared

If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war, we can take it there
[Verse 3]
You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft
You talk but you scared to go back up North
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nothing
Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop fronting
You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor
So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line
I got nines, every color shape and design
I sent killers every race to put one in your spine
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?
Nobody never get involved and none of 'em dying
I think like you do, roll with about two irons
Catch me flying high in the aircraft, wining and dining
You die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass
The rich ass, they gauze up, your stab wounds
While I'm getting head, in a Lear jet, bathroom
With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases
Full of paper, not money it's bank statements
We Illmatic that explains how we rock
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block

[Chorus]
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared

One .44, two .45's
Three loaded clips, four niggas roll, one nigga drives
Five hundred Benz, six reasons why this kid should die
We shooting every mothafucka outside
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car
Guns in our hand, at the same time everybody ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, seven shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor then we shot some more
Niggas he was with two niggas hit, one nigga fell
One tried to run, go get him son
Make sure he's done 'fore we bail, I ain't tryna go to jail
Must handle beef, code of the street, load up the heat
If these nigga think they could fuck around
Real niggas do real things by all means
Niggas knowing how we get down, it goes
[Chorus]
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?
(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?

Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?

[Verse 2]
Driving through roads, Suburban Chevrolet
Six tinted windows, and I'm on my way
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
Ringing the bell, where in the hell, could they be at?
I'm about to leave stepping slow, where my truck was at
Who the fuck is that? Could it be a jack?
Now pull my strap, it's my man and we have the same plan
There them bitches go, Civic '94
Looking funny though, open up the car door, funny smile
Fuck two already, third ass was heavy
""Nas this is Sherry, Sherry this is Nas and his man, ready?""
Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes
Ran through them hoes, plenty ice, that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man, heard a blam-blam
Now I'm wondering, ""In this scam, do I even stand a chance?""
He killed the hoes, took all they dough
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky coming down the stairs
Now he wanting mine, reaching for my nine
Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time
My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
""Put your gun down, we can skip town""
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain, took his shit, emptied out close range
[Chorus]
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?
(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?

How could I forget this

Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds, we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'
These are last words of a hanging slave

I wanna be more than that bullet that go through ya zone
Wanna be the lead that tear through ya skin and crack bones
Wanna be the heat you feel makin' ya moan
Wanna be the hospital bed that you lay on
Wanna be the god you feel when you pray-on
It's Nashawn the type that get the hyper calm
I'm gonna kill somethin', rap cats be real frontin'
Fuck shootin' legs, cock back put his brains on the pave
Nigga how 'bout that, close range with the gauge get payed
First rapper to shoot off stage
Turn the front page the next day, my life is like a book
A twenty four hour song without no hook
Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug
Turn corners when you turn corners, know who to plug
Thugs around me outside its grimy outside
Better slide before you get bodied outside

I'ma prison cell six by nine
Livin' hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail
My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house
I'm the place many fear 'cause there's no way out
I take the sun away put misery instead
When you with me most folks consider you dead
I saw too many inmates fallin' apart
Call for the guards to let them out at night when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whisperin')
I make it hotter in the summer, colder in the winter
If the court parole ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen 'em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
'Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunnin' when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is comin'
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal...

Me and my Dunns come from the slums
You can't take the slums out my Dunns
And that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days
Not caring, bout what they gon' think or say
I got that, I don't give a fuck in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve, putting out them songs
Knowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on
We just getting warm, operation Quiet Storm
Silent wars or we silence the fours
Hav, P, and Nas, got it in the smash, fo'sho
Now it's movies and soundtracks
This is where your career stop at

[Verse 2: Nas]
Ayo, I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You violate, they read your obituary in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait 'til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope slangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rastas, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
D's on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big white boys with guns yelling, ""Freeze black kids!""
Got my niggas in the pen, eating octopus
Wishing they was on the blocks with us
To watch me and P do it (uh), put the heat to it (uh)
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
And think deep to it, now who the truest?

Yo you fam to me, and only fam to me
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong

Dirty fingernails, reaching in my pocket pulling knots out
I daydream of better days, in different ways
Out this lifestyle we live, iced-out with the big fifth
That's why the burnt leather lean to the left
Even though we gained cash on fish
I'm trapped on reason being we ain't all rich
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door
And I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash
We get stacks, you do the math
We pound niggas out, walk away and laugh
Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus, kid
Rap niggas shit they drawers
[Verse 4: Nas]
Yo they probably did
I aircondition y'all niggas, my prediction is you rewind this
Your highness, Q-Boro's finest
Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listening hard
To my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up
Feeling like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, being looked at, it's uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
No heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight
Y'all niggas get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue
We too official, blue steel pistols
Teflon vests, it's no contest, we hit you

I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart
By the beast but he missed his mark
Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up
When I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all
Yo it came to me, the pain in me
Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be
It strangely seemed, like it was a dream
But the si-rens had never woke me
Only reason I'm here now is 'cause God chose me
And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga
But God love us hood niggas

[Chorus]
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause he be with us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh
But he forgive us
[Verse 2]
Day by day by day I sit back and pray
My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage
They pass away, they went off the casket way
My gats will spray, but that won't bring 'em back today
So long my crimes now gone for eternity
The team we got left on the set, now turn to me
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
I ride past the church where they got his body and find
They takin' him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses
Loadin' clips up, countin' bullets carefully
For self, though it feels like, he was there for me
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin' me

[Chorus]
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause he be with us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh
But he forgive us
[Verse 3]
Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood
Thugs with guns become celebrities in the hood
Yo it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood
Little girls have seeds by OGs in the hood
It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood
You can choose if you would, coke to sniff
Dope to ooze in your blood, parolees
Ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood
You can starve in the hood
Your best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood
But it's good in the hood, I was raised in the hood
Was taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood
I stays in the hood, got my ways from the hood
Learned to play ball go to the NBA, in the hood
There's AIDS (uh), in the hood (WHAT?)
Our lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke
That's the main reason why God, love us the most

[Chorus]
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause he be with us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh
But he forgive us
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause he be with us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)

[Intro: Nas]
Where my real niggas at
There's a lot of real niggas out there
There's a lot of real niggas everywhere
That's why you don't fuck with just anybody
A lot of niggas is just on the low, chillin'
Not botherin' nobody, until one muthafucka fuck with 'em
And then all hell break loose
[Chorus: Nas]
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga

[Verse 1: Grand Wizard]
Well known gangstas, entrust, that we bust
Your heart and soul lies with us, let's see
Boldly go where we once took a nigga before
Now the motherfucker beggin' for more
It's Thorazine
Standin' here shakin', hatin' the haters, they watchin' my paper
Realize, a 4-5 will open his eyes
Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop?
Nigga standin' there just like a cop
Braveheart I'm screamin up the block
Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact
Don't let me get up and show y'all muthafuckas respect
Plans connect
The twinklin' diamonds upon my neck
More Jazz than Hornacek
I blast, leave your corner wet
Straight on top of ya
Spittin' like the Trench Coat Mafia
In a schoolyard, we make it hard
What's poppin' y'all?
We made our change; what's stoppin' y'all?
They spray y'all names Rest in Peace on the project wall

[Verse 2: Horse]
I wave gang signs at the youth, that's down for the cause
Sling them things 'til the very end, you better get yours
Time is runnin' out
Your streets is gettin' smaller as we speak
Giuliani turns these lights on so niggas can't creep
I miss the shit out of David Dinkins
Please free John Gotti
They kept the black man eatin', not killin' everybody
Drug wars is real
You have no friends in the outfield
Foul balls is death, umpires keep ice grills
There's no tomorrow, it's the bottom of the 9-9
Can't die a broke man with a bitch that's fine
My heart's full of braveness, so who the fuck will want to save this
Fallen angel from fallen, startin' chaos on this nation
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'
You could find us in the hood, thuggin' and regulatin'
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'
You could find us in the hood, thuggin' and regulatin'
[Chorus: Nas]
Quiet niggas will kill

Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga

Or is you a paid nigga
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga

[Verse 3: Jungle]
Yo, we here to eat food, my peoples be lethal
Shots in your body make you see-through
Quiet niggas become jail riot niggas
25 to life bid, never cry niggas
Floss when they up north
Chest gettin' bigger
Celebs on the V.I., respect that nigga
Reggy on the regular, chops it up, like a editor
Come through one man gang like The Predator
If your wake, I'll wet it up, Jungle set it up
The jackal rock you to sleep while I'm comin' at you
Air out your area, Queensbridge forever, what
Ill Will the label
Bravehearts, y'all scared of us

[Verse 4: Nas]
Yo, when those niggas ran, these niggas stayed
When those niggas switched up and bitched up afraid
These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge
Those niggas got jail and sick 'cause we paid
Don't even rep QB, you ain't got hood stripes
Looters come through catch you frontin' and it's goodnight
Know how much force this is
Jungle, Horse, and Wiz
Nothin' but horses, kid
We go to war for this

(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba
[Verse 1]
I'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace
Get you hype when I lick it, put it by your face
Sipping red wine, is it bedtime
You can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith
I'm feeling richer today,I can hit it then stay
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
It's your night, no stress, no fight
Mad at your ex, 'cause his dough tight
Never go right when you're with him
Try your best to forget him
'Cause it's easy to please me
CD skip when your head board hit the wall
Call for the lord
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
You can hit a blunt if you want
I'ma pull my pants up
We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
Tell me what's the reason for us
To love or to fuck
I'm the thug that you want
If it's gangster we can't front
If you want me I can stay around
If you need me, I'm here for you
How that sound?
Now it's up to you
Depending on how you wanna get down
'Cause you're a big girl now

Got your own home and you alone

[Verse 2]
Got your name and your number in my cell phone
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone
If you in a good mood, if you not
Or you thinking bout you was at my spot
What we did when we got hot
Is you dreaming you had me?
Is you creaming your panties?
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
And we ate each other like candy
Under the covers, two intimate lovers
You fuck a nigga like you mad at me
Throw the ass to me
You should be glad to be
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say ""Oh God""
Every ho that you know wanna know Nas
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
'Cause you know how these girls are
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
Starting to get an erection
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
I need time to breathe
Wanna follow me, ironically
You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe
Like it's my fault
But you don't wanna talk
Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden
You and the shorty start scuffing
Now shorty dumping you out
Can't let her get the best of you
So I rescue you
Only thing left to do was to grab her
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot
You don't wanna feel chumped
Now here the cops come
So we gotta run to the ride
Then we drive off through the traffic
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
Looking at your face
And the damage in your facial
Every angle can't let it faze you
No reason to be insecure or immature
Baby girl, see the world is yours

Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out

13.0,New World,Nastradamus,1999,"New World Lyrics[Intro]
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world
It's a new world, it's a new world
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world

[Verse 1]
Yo, celebrate the new life
New ways to make money
New ways to break dummies
Forge they name and take money
Computers ain't that smart
Whatever man built could be taken apart
Anything new can get old
Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some stopped wearin' gold
Solar-energized rides, no steerin' wheel, tell it how to drive
No propellers in the sky
Airplanes like many rockets
Waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars
While the poor people starve, computers takin' over they jobs
A man's forced to live off land
Now it's back to the caveman era
When we made fire, by two sticks rubbin' together
The truth is, many are too scared of new data
America Online, cut off, see you later
[Chorus]
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'
New life for man, children, and women
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'
New life for man, children, and women

[Verse 2]
Yo, the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones
Bill Clinton's the new JFK, without the hole in his dome
The new Don Trump is Bill Gates
Not because his occupation, it's 'cause we respect his cake
And cake mean his stock, net gross
Young kids step it up, go for the most
New cameras in police cars takin' pictures
New hustlas gettin' new street figures
And US embassies overseas
Almost every foreign country's under siege
Covertly startin' wars, CIA, NAVY Seals
Commit larcenies that be worth over mil's
Oil in the earth spills
Girls blow they body up, birth control pills
African's pick diamonds out a dark caves
Then we wear it on our necks just so we can light up the stage
[Chorus]
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'
New life for man, children, and women

[Verse 3]
Say goodbye to the brainwashed
Say goodbye to the young kids who not smart
Say goodbye to the toasters and Pop-Tarts
Yo, it's real
Swallow a little pill, there's a four-course meal
Say hello to the one world
Say hello to the sky, something's out there watchin' you and I
More enticin' than Star Trek, StarTAC phones
Your genes and DNA is used to make clones
You got CD-Rom, everything operates by computers
Then what happens when circuit breaks?
Y2K's the big scare
Scientists say we ain't prepared
What I feel is contrare
Alexander Graham Bell made telephones, yes
But now we request for your e-mail address
I might be old fashioned, stuck in my ways
But nothin' make me more happier than seein' today

Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'

Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it
Brothers on lockdown on their cot feel it

On top out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holla
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs in renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies looking proper
Look good enough to be taken shopping
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

15.0,The Outcome,Nastradamus,1999,"The Outcome Lyrics[Jessica Care Moore]
Global warming between my legs, screams against the waves
Gave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water
My skin layered in diamonds and sage
Left alone in confused forest's, enslaved by days
Time keeps on whorin us
Ghetto saviors can't keep ignorin us
Flowers and flames flew from her fingers
Rifles pointed from her sac
Or was it simply a bag of sticks and stones
Either way, she wore a compass on her head
Rains don't stop the grass from turnin red
Her hair was half permed, half dread
We gave up walking in a past-life and so we danced
Arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life
A new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice
Symbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run
Time travelling was late
Watching was a blind man's mistake
All his assets melted right in front of his face
His right leg drabbed with demon pace
Shoes stayed angel laced
Never count your blessings with haste
Even a prophet can catch a case
Didn't realize how sweet the future might taste
Telepathically cutting through mental gates
Words were weapons against their hate
Shepherds search for stars in her hair
Her chest grew fermented like yeast
She broke her body like aged bread
He gave her truth from all the books he'd read
She wrote her poems inside the mud
Sacrificed her cervix to fix the future
Named their poison, spit truth inside his mouth
Read warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly
Resurrected from bones and dirt
She made hard niggas smile
Left her seeds inside the Earth
Gave hustlers and killers life's worth
This is the life we chose, remember who was here first
Find a reason why you curse
Gold rushed tongues by dreams too loose
Sporting electronic nooses
Hoeing humanity love takes over lust
Despite the damage to Destiny
You can't take the best of me, In God We Still Trust3Embed"

It's just hot, until a nigga can't take it no more
Blood of a slave, heart of a King, turn my voice up

[Verse]
Ayo, the brother's Stillmatic
I crawled up out of that grave, wipin' the dirt, cleanin' my shirt
They thought I'd make another Illmatic
But it's always forward I'm movin'
Never backwards, stupid, here's another classic
C-notes is fallin' from the sky, by now the credits roll
They're starrin' Nas, executive poet, produced, directed by
The Kid slash Escobar, narration describes
The lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin' to survive
The feature opens with this young black child, fingers scratched
Cigarette burns on the sofa, turnin' the TV down
While Mary Jane Girls, 45's playin', soft in the background
Food from C-Town's, mornings was hash browns
Stepped over dope fiends, walkin' out the door, all of us poor
I learned the difference 'tween the snitches
The real ones, and who's soft, and the murderous, hungriest crews
People jumpin' from roofs
Shotguns pumpin', made it through my youth
Walkin' very thin lines, ages seven and nine
That's the age I was on my album cover, this is the rebirth
I know the streets thirst water like Moses
Walkin' through the hot desert searchin' to be free
This is my ending and my new beginning, nostalgia
Alpha and Omega places, it's like a glitch in The Matrix
I seen it all, did it all, most of y'all will pop for a minute
Spit a sentence then the game'll get rid of y'all
Y'all got there but y'all ain't get it all, I want my style back
Hate to cease y'all plan, it's the rap–repo man
To them double up hustlers, bidders, niggas who real
Professional stick-up kids dreamin' for mils
Let my words guide you, get inside you
From Crips to Pirus, this is survival

(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already

[Verse 2]
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (Uh)
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishin' (Bitch niggas), friendly-actin', envy-hidin' snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef (What?)
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel (Haha) and his soldiers I can handle
This for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made a album called Blueprint (Dick)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G., dick-suckin' lips (Ha)
Why don't you let the late, great veteran live?
[Interlude]
I will
Not lose (God's son across the belly, I'll prove you lost already), uh
The king is back
Where my crown at? (Ill Will)
Ill Will, rest in peace, let's do it, niggas

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already
[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I'll still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn, though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow (Burn slow)
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy (Ill)
Rockefeller died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all tryna take my spot, fellas?
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now 'cause of your looks? (Girls, girls, girls, haha)
Negro, please, ha, you no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans, you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane, to Irv, to B.I.G
And Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons, ha
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn, you on Jaz dick
So little Shawny's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips? (Nigga)
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss170Embed"

Woke up this mornin' (Yeah)
You got yourself a gun (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got yourself a gun

[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines, so
I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun
[Verse 1: Nas]
My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome, I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames could huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody

[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]
I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun

You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun, yo

I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed, hair parted with a
Barber's preciseness, Bravehearted for life, it's
Return of the golden child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu's, tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never, 'member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me God's Son with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]
I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun
[Verse 3: Nas]
It's the return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist', I floss
Stick shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (Uh)

Zoom, from outer space he comes
Blunt in his mouth with his hand on his gun
Bitches flappin' they gums, do he be clappin' and shootin' guys?
Actor or a movie star, rapper revolutionized?
What is his race, nation, or creed?
Is he Arabic, Black, Latin, Asian? They read
Magazines say I walked on water, talked to the heavens
Spit at judges, stepped on peasants
But in reality, I just entered your galaxy
September '73, up in these wild streets
Fuckin' these wild freaks, a harem of hoes (Goddamn)
And my mystique got 'em tearin' my clothes

Only way you die if it's meant to be

No discussion is the principle, we bust and it's the end of you
Now we knockin' on your mama door

Paramedics fightin' for you, who's gon' win?
The hands of time, or the hands of medicine?
Don't cry, witness your fate, this is your wake
Walk by your casket, spit in your face
Enter the fog, dawg, the light is your guide
And when you're gone all your niggas gon' light it with Nas

Do it like this, niggas, right hands in the air
Ball it to a fist and put it over your heart
Now let's say it all together, let the ceremony start
""I shall stay real, stay true, stay holdin' figures
Never put a bitch over my niggas
I shall never cooperate with the law
Never snake me, I'll always hold you down in war
If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs
I never break the oath to the death, I swear""

Of underworlds, killers and thugs, though the science
Of a nigga still yet to be found

They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas too real, Nas, true king
It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists, only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's ""Fuck Nas""
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since Barbeque
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I ever make a record, I'll take a check
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with cracks in my sock, 'sleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the craft of the streets
But look at me now

Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man

Listen up, gangstas and honeys with your hair done
Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son
Dog, whatever they call you, God, just listen
I'll spit a story backwards, it starts at the endin'
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet holes close in this chest of a nigga, now he back to square one
Screamin', ""shoot don't please"", I put my fifth back on my hip
It's like a VCR rewindin' a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch, my caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van, they closin' shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, ""Go he there""
Sittin' back in his chair, we hittin' the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin' records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van, back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, ""Outside right we""
So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
'Cause Jungle said, ""Block your on enemy's the""
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed, thinkin' about this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, ""No hell,"" she talkin' 'bout, ""Me kiss""
Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick
Started suckin' with no hands, a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, ""Stressed really I'm""
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said, ""Son, we found that nigga we gotta kill""

Ayo, son, ayo, son, you hear me? You hear me?

One time

Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee, I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon, sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with nines out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now

All I need is one mic (That's all I need)
All I need is one mic (All I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me, fuck all of them
Jesus died at age thirty-three, there's thirty-three shots
From twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means one of my guns was holdin' seventeen
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, two mini nines
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way, they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now
[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (That's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (There's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (That's all a nigga need to do his thing, you know?)
All I need is one mic (This is all I need)

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is, I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blastin' 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed, body found in a dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous 'cause fiends got they work and complained
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true, she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon 'cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now
[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All I need is one mic (All I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (Fuck the cars, the jewelry)

Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin' out Chryslers, e-z wider paper
Pops puffin' his cess, punchin' his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychos, killers
Saw Divine, Goon, and Chongo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin' front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew all that I'd seen had meant somethin'
Learned early to fear none, little Nas was huntin'
Livin' carefree laughin', got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin' like some old folks, y'all don't hear me
Yo, I'm in my second childhood

Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair, still slingin', got a crew
They break his mom's furniture, watchin' Comicview
Got babies by different ladies, high, smokin' L's
In the same spot he stood since '85, well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin' on different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes, it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him, right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood

Always actin' tough, a jokester be frontin'
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothin'
But that's Nas always lookin' out for bredren
'Cause when bredren don't return love it don't stress him
'Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughin' to the bank and shit
Back to Cor', got him a deal but his rhymes was wack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious, kid
Mega, for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch, you from around the way, it's sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity
[Refrain]
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So now they say

[Verse 2]
Since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies
Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood, dummies
There's plenty that wanna be me but cannot
It's like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what, nigga? You're butt and it got back to me
Askin' a Braveheart to help get back your jewelry
You ain't from my hood, don't even rep Q.B
Nature moved to Marcy
(Man dick riding Nature) Nothing else to say
Man, Nature moved to Marcy (What? Far)
Backward ass niggas, man, fuck them niggas (Far away)
Go 'head with the program, man, proceed
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Course we ain't friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, it's just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity
[Refrain]
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So now they say

[Verse 3]
I put the name on the map after Marley and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
I had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleanin' up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P, how many times ain't you shamed that
Jungle was bustin' his gun to get your weak chain back
They don't respect you, a check's due for me for your fame
Mega, I hope you blow so I'm sayin' your name (Mega, Mega)
Hoes play your position 'cause you'll never be King
Even Jigga want the crown, ""How that sound?"" Poor thing
I'm representin' Queensbridge U.S.A
Where two SK's go off every day ruthless-lay
All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say
[Refrain]
(The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So now they say

[Outro]
""The Bridge is over,"" my dick
The Bridge'll never be over, long as I'm alive and breathin'
Braveheart to the graveyard
I'm the William Wallace of this shit
Ayo, P, Prodigy I got love for you, man, I love you, man
You know what I'm sayin'?
Just get them unloyal niggas from out your circle
You can't save everybody
Niggas invited you to the hood, rep it right, my nigga
Be untouchable, my nigga
So it be Mobb for life for real, and that's real
Ayo, Nature, I can't hold your hand through this shit, man
I'm not your father, man
Be your own man, stand on your own two
I believe in you, believe in yourself, nigga
Or don't even rep this, man
Ayo, Mega you wanna be a gangsta?
There's real gangsta shit going on in the streets, man
Yo niggas is in the grind
Where you be at man? Niggas be buckin'
Why you never buckin'? Where you be at, man?
All of a sudden you the motherfuckin' Nino Brown of the fuckin' hood?
It's disgusting, man, stay out the magazines
Keep my name out your motherfuckin' mouth
There's no more room for jealousy, we destroyin' and rebuildin'
That means the cowards get out and real niggas stay
Niggas been hating me since I been nine
Shining with suede motherfucking Bally's on and silks
I'ma always be the young don
Don't be like the niggas on the other side
Hating me 'cause I'm beautiful
Real niggas in Queensbridge
Y'all niggas come up and get this money and move on, baby

Bring it to a whole, you know?

Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like you don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough

Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome

Follow, I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo
Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy
The one the playa haters hate dearly, but can't near me
Homicide can't scare me
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga
The type that can build with ya
Verbalize, bring life to a still picture, it's God-given
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison
Play with me, I'm modest 'til them strays hit me
Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy
Dough forever, the live stay low forever
And fuck niggas 'cause it's hard to keep them close together
One dependent, no wife, one co-defendant
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance

Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feelin'
Live how I live, it's only 'cause I been through it
Learn to try it, like to eat it and shit, it's nuttin' to it
Burn it, light it, weed it and off the liquor
While drivin' outside I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sights, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
'Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin', evil be gone, say it
I'm proud of Mase for givin' himself to the Lord
Wonderin' does Faith think about Big anymore
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin'
We ain't these little niggas no more, runnin' dangerous

Identity sealed, protected by our energy shield
And fuck a drop 'cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed
Close the book
Was taught never expose a crook
Between the knight and the bishop
One'll knock ya rook

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Nas, uh
Yo, yo
Life, they wonder, can they take me under?
Nah, never that, nah, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Nas]
I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest every day as a child
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars, but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt up to Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanistan
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop acting like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time, it's been men with arms fighting
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then
Must it go on? We must stop the killing
Tell me why we die, we all God's children
[Chorus: Nas and Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever (Uh, come on)
It's time that we stand together (Yeah, for the world)

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it
That's they corner, from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like, ""Dog you safe whenever you with me, see, this is my town""
So the youngsters grows in ghettos, goes to prison
At a early age already know what's against him
So in order for him to survive
One day he must open up his eyes to the setbacks and rise
'Cause everybody wants a shot
In this land of opportunity, look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet?
The Earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds is to whom it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks, and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources, all its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service?
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo
[Chorus: Nas and Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever (Uh, come on)
It's time that we stand together (Yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (What? What? What? What? What? Come on)

Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain in cause
You alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a highlight now
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again
Hoping I reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In hip-hop, the weapons are lyrical
To be the best, you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
Top of the world for the kid, none less
Poppin' any rapper's head off his shoulders, no contest
I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me
You scared of a mirror, my theory is that knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now

Whatever you want out of life, whatever you feel is rightfully yours

Ayo, it's packed on this Rikers bus
The tightest cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killer
Mother's a dope fiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends in the street, smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a '72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably three
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor who left stocks for me?
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shorties gots to eat
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry

You that foe, then it's all over soldier
Hummers and Ranges through the desert, fuck a twenty-inch
Long as we got gas and we got water
Troopers lookin' for manslaughter, I gotta get back
For what they owe, shoot 'em in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag, hogtie, gag
Forget the life had, now we all rebels
Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
We can see for miles, the land, it's major rubble
And debris from the Earth as we knew crumble
Yo, you could see the sea and the stars look closer to me
I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie, Mad Max

Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape
How is the war, and, yo, I'm wishin' I was in your shoes
Holdin' machine guns, clean fun
Shootin' dudes with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
It's America's plan, every color of man inherits the shit
Yo, I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
I know the warden is readin' the scribe, but, yo, I swear
It's a billion dollar business, courts, lawyers and jails
We all slaves in the system, I'm 'bout to rebel

There's not a bitch in sight or a block bench
All-black gate, all-gray fence
Look who fucked it all up, Mr. President
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
Now it's state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart
What a bloody mess, a slug fest
I just buried eight of mine
At night I hear grown men cryin'
You know I'm spittin' mine, I ain't goin' out here
We gotta win, every time I hear the wind I think a slug went in
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass
I don't know what they broadcast, the newsflash is fake
Every day I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say

In hospitals, shots riddle the block
Little children and elderly women run for they lives
Drizzlin' rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
Must be out my fuckin' mind, what is this, the hundredth time?
Sendin' flowers to funerals, readin' ""Rest In Peace""
You know, the usual, death comes in threes
""Life is short"" is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
And funny how these black-killer companies is makin' money off us
Fast food, Cola, soda, Skull and Bone crosses

When pregnant, drop out of school or have abortions
Stop workin', hopin' that they find a man that will support them
Up late night, on they mother's cordless
Thinkin' a perm or bleachin' cream will make them better, when they gorgeous
White girls tannin', liposuction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips, that's life destruction
Light-skinned women, bi-racial, hateful
Toward themselves, denyin' even they blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods, but I
Overstand the mental poison that's even worser than drugs

Yo, it's poison

And any thoughts of takin' me down is poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint them, plaow

Never to worry
All the wrong-doers got it comin' back to 'em a thousand times over
Every dog has its day, and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it comin' back to 'em

Innocent lives will be taken, it may get worse
But we'll get through it, y'all, be strong

Uh, yeah, uh
Blessings of life to the children, they say life is like five days
Words of a old man with silver hair, in his wheelchair
His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have to kill ya
'Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, cop a new five
Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war, we life stealers, hollow-tip lead busters
There's no Heaven or Hell, dead is dead, fuckers
And your soul is with God, your mind keeps lurkin' the earth
Watchin' your own murder reoccur
[Chorus: Blitz]
For every struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For every struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning

It's Blitz, nigga, the streets glory, many die for me
Got knocked, refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me
Basically I'm just reality, loaded with foul stories of lust
Greed and contempt, no street is exempt
Extended clip shots, hoods barricaded for six blocks
I sip shots, watchin' 'em hustlers pitch rocks
Oil paintin' pictures of my pain, illustrate the city in vain
Fallin' deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind, in these fatal times
Vest crimes, nickel-plated nines and niggas for the dime
Hear the sounds of them babies cry, still I'm sayin' why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die?
Stayin' high to relieve the pain, breathin' in the game
Exhalin' guilt, sin and shame, misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring, luck or anthrax?
I stand back, hopin' I'll make it through tomorrow
[Verse 3: Nas]
My skin is a art gallery, right, with paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin' the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benzes and feel no remorse?
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des?
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She know what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess, it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous?
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely, hold me, it's gettin' darker

[Chorus: Blitz]
For every struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For every struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning5Embed"
1.0,Doo Rags,The Lost Tapes,2002,"Doo Rags Lyrics[Produced by Precision]

[Verse 1]
Pushin' drop-tops, Stacy Lattisaw tapes, the 80's had us all apes
Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants, yeah
X-Clan hair, with dreads at the top of my fade
Homicidal feds on the blocks where I played b-ball
That's when I wondered was I here for the cause or because
'Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto
Was told to stay strong and I could beat the devil
'Cause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats
Watchin' niggas swing razors in the front row
Then out in the streets, the car show, 560's, chemical Afros
Acuras pumpin' Super Lover Cee and Casanova
Live chicks be asses bustin' out of they clothes
Wearin' lip gloss, big door knockers peelin' they earlobes
So where them years go?
Where the Old Gold beers and cheers go?
But now them shorties here though, so
[Chorus]
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right?

[Verse 2]
Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers
In army boots, yellin', ""Join the armed forces!""
We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons
Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes
There's still a lot of nigga crawlin' in the corporate offices
War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us
They won't be servin' the beast too long
The murderers wearin' police uniforms, Confederate flags I burn
Beat Street breakers were dancin' to the music I chose
And Peachtree, Atlanta crackheads was tootin' they nose
In frozen corners of Chicago
Loaded-up llamas, children with fo'-fo's and double-revolvers
We devil incarnates headed for jail
Where Shell gas company in South Africa be havin' us killed
Your paper money was the death of Christ
And all these shorties comin' up just resurrect your life
It's like a cycle, yo
[Chorus]
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right?

[Verse 3]
Niggas used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up
That's when we were lied to, buyin' hair products
Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegratin' till awareness started penetratin'
The styles come from prison, they used potatoes makin' liquor
Just to prove we some creative niggas
Turnin' nothin' into somethin' is God work
And you get nothin' without struggle and hard work
War is necessary to my niggas in chains
From Green to Sing-Sing I'm wantin' y'all to know one thing
The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does
Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves
Take one step toward him, He takes two toward you
Even when all else fail, God support you
I done it, got ""God's Son"" on my stomach
My heart and my lungs was affected
From Henny's and gettin' blunted
Do your body right and it loves you back
You only get one life, and yo, because of that
I'm still blazin', goin' out for the cause
Still rockin' stockin' caps, not for the waves, obeyin' no laws
And it's like that
[Chorus]
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time

The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb

2.0,My Way,The Lost Tapes,2002,"My Way Lyrics[Verse 1]
Word to Will, buried in his Fila suit and heavy chain
I wanna be iced-up, nigga, bury me the same
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose drawers
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss
Guns under my bed, mask and a flashlight
Livin' my life like everyday's my last night
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
Mommy told me from weed I would switch drugs
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack on?
Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms
Boppin' to The Supremes, smokin' joints
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want
[Chorus 1]
(I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) from break dancin', backspins on the cardboard
(I did it my way) to bulletproof Bentleys, Gats in the car door
(I did it my way) never gave a fuck what nobody said
(I did it my way) they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead
(I did it my way) if I fuck up, it falls on me
(I did it my way) I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat

[Verse 2]
Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers
Jacuzzi's, Gucci soap, throwin' cash in the air
Though I still feel broke with millions in the bank
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat
And just to think some would die to get what I got
They think it's a lot; in the blink of an eye, you could get shot
Niggas is wolves, comin' if you ruthless or not
But I be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
Never knew murder 'til I seen my man get popped
No blood soakin', layin' there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was lookin' right through me, yo, starin' beyond
I wonder what he saw: the limos, movies and tours?
Did he die in vain or represent for the cause?
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved
And that's the game; y'all can't relate, fuck y'all (Ill Will)
[Chorus 2]
(I did it my way) from the crumbs, roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) I call it how I see it, niggas
(I did it my way) if you don't like it, so be it, niggas
(I did it my way) I make my own rules, do my own plans
(I did it my way) gangstas do what they want, suckers do what they can
(I did it my way) takin' sacrifices, kid
(I did it my way) you only gettin' one life to live

[Verse 3]
Yo, hoes in my focus slow me; roll with the brokest homies
Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scoldin' my foes who phony
From blocks where coke'll feed you, and cops is over-evil
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesel
Her-on and blow, it ruins minds, knew a crew one time
'89, they took work to Caroline and blew big time
In just two years, their crew disappeared
Snitches and bitches smeared the paint on their pictures
Years back, I reminisce and remember
Sittin' on wood benches gave me splinters
Just a baby nigga thankful
When them killers came through, guns out, movin'
I thank the ones who said
""Shorty, go home, we about to be shootin'""
[Chorus 1]
(I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) from break dancin', back spins on the cardboard
(I did it my way) to bulletproof Bentleys, Gats in the car door
(I did it my way) never gave a fuck what nobody said

[Verse 1]
Nastradamus, skama lit, know when I rep
Flow when I'm set, I got the chips to make a Lotus my whip
Gold on my neck was once a code of respect
For high rollers and vets
Now it's loads of baguettes
Prefer a MAC-10 over a TEC
No matter sober or wet, I smack soldier cadets
Trees that might eject my hype back
Famous phrase ""Nigga, light that""
Hoes you fuck ask you, ""Where your ice at, dunn?""
It's all about Playboys when we was young
Could only get tongue, then finally we can cum
Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's
Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro
From bottles, to seven in your hand
To fake Pepsi's, to get to the crack, unscrew the can
Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it
We got it if the fiends want it
The whole block singing the same theme ""Don it""
Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket
If it's ice work, I'm gonna truck it
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

(It's what they want) fuck it
(It's what they want) you gotta love it

[Verse 2]
Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist
Compulsive, with malice incentives, the foulest of bitches
Hunger my riches, her childish wishes
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
Kicking this flow, slip and you fold
So when your click roll, I let my clips go
Niggas on opposite poles
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
Inhumane, living hostile opposed
To living on the street, proper from my top to my toes
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in suburbans with liquor
Preposterous foes, finicky foul niggas
See niggas and blacks, there goes a loud difference
Coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching
Regardless, we still make you a target
We shoot you in jail, chrome objects
Hit you in your own projects, it's street-onomics
This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics
Miserable cats, hunger paining
Get off your ass, stop complaining
My crew be in Montego Bay margariting, marinating
While you home, waiting your arraignment
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment
Now back in the hood, certain cats, they wanna kill me
They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

You gon' get everything you ever wanted, baby
That's my word

[Verse 1]
My niggas come home from long bids
They check for me before they see their own kids
I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tourin'
Major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers
Cop Ferraris with navigational screens
Guide us through your hood and any locality, then back to Queens
Piped out seats, Oakwood MB cord speakers
Bumpin' out old shit
That made me think of Old Easters '86 in a Le Tigre short sleeves
Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' fucked up
From Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt
100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts
Back then, nobody wore a vest
Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test
Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot, wylin'
Look at the chain I snatched with the medallion worth a thousand
Cops rushed, the God done made it home smilin'
Half of the crew? Prob'ly on the island
Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger
Playin' corners, stick the elevator never thought
Project life would promise nothin' but to die trife
For steppin' on the next man's Nikes, my motto: look for tomorrow
Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way
Gats spray, these shorties is killers
The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller
And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in
Like 'who's you?' when I cruise through
I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends
Be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever
[Chorus]
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever, ya know? Yo
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever (Yo)

Nice cars, livin' like a star, club-hoppin'
Poppin' bottles at the bar, love shoppin'
Gucci iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs
One for your wife, one for your freak
Silver-spurs Rolls Royce, too good to be true, houses worth 2.2
Pool parties, beautiful view
You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style, baggy jeans style
Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile
Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses
Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'
Thinkin', ""Damn, wish my niggas could afford this""
On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless
Talkin' to lawyers, accountants, investments
Money doubles, triples, protect it: hard work you manifested
Worries of failure, when you buried is your familia
Gon' keep your name prosperin' to the maximum?
You should live, there's only one life, that's the physical
Rich or poor or in jail, why the fuck should you be miserable?
Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'
Love could have your heartbeat skippin', thugs turn to religion
The bitch you love could start to hate you
The shit you used to do escape you
Things that make you laugh represent the past
Reminisce the block, gamble Gs on the floor
Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more
Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down
Turned 'em into shopping malls, the hood is like a ghost town
Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still
Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real
[Chorus]
Everything must eventually come to an end
So try to savor your moments, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever, ya know?
Everything will eventually come to an end

If niggas could look inside my mind, you'll find
Where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the brain cell graveyard
Where weed's responsible for memory loss
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
See what I seen every day I live with this torture
Lightin' spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
Long as I'm still breathin' I'm still winnin', I'll teach 'em
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill
Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane
No Half Steppin' with flat tops when Rakim reigned
Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin'
Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children
And this was goin' on in every New York ghetto
Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork in Jell-o
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference
On a different coast, but we share the same sunlight
Your part of the world might be like colors and gangs
While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis
Them treacherous rastas in the Mexican mafias
Be scrappin' with tats on they back, violent wars
Nothin' less than a lethal injection if ever caught
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
Watchin' for paint chips, don't want no lead in yo' child
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out
The chain be like a hundred K
Shinin' since Roxanne Shante' made Runaway; that's been a minute
Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas
My Exodus doesn't exist, I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind
Even with sleep I'm duckin' nines in my dreams
Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things
Like, somebody's always watchin'
My life before I, walk out the door I size up every option
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns
Which is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one
I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled

Brazilian candy, from Miami
Masseuse, wedding ring on, loving Celine Dion
Hate rap, told me where she get cake at
She's a part-time dancer, part time romancer
Tries to be a mother when she gets a chance to
Left her husband alone to raise they son, he's in Pampers
Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree
33, recovering from plastic surgery
Went from 34B to 36 double D
Met her in San Diego at the Super Bowl party
Had the Henny, sipped it up with Terrell Davis
MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated
I was silked out, flossin' with Stoute, he had the 'gators
When she walked in, she lit up the room like Las Vegas
Terrell said her man's a fullback for the Raiders
A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers
It's easy to hit the pussy, just don't fall in love
Next thing you know I'm hugged up with this bitch in the tub
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washin' her feet
Is this love? Somebody's wife fucking a thug
Hittin' it raw, tastin' it, wildin' out of my character
Tapin' it, Tyra Banks face and Faith's lips
Givin' head like she knew me for years
Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me 'bout her husband's affairs
Millions she would get if his neck got slit
She rolled the equality, then passed the lye to me
Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy
He stays on the golf course, wears Le Coq Sportif
Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort
You can take him there, here go the keys, you can slip in the rear
Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere
So we can make more money, then you could ever see rappin'
Split the cash and move to Venezuela, adaptin'
P-11's, ACP shells for blastin'
Caught him with his Spanish maid
He had a lighter with a can of spray, burnin' her legs
She tied to the bed, sex S&M, sadomasochistic
Sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out existence
His maid cried ""No"", lucky she was blindfold
Naked with mad burn marks all on her thighs, yo
Twelve point five million, he kept his funds
In the Lloyd's of London, goes to his wife and his children
Yo, I thought ""What if shorty gets scared, electric chair's all I envision
All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision""
I switched the plan, the maid flied to Switzerland
Fake ID, forged his wife name, catch the next flight
The same night, headed to Spain, nice game
Now we're back to where we meet a-gain...

Top down, night air blow her hair
Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare
Fast lane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash

Snorted it, started screamin', yo we almost crashed
Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it with crushed up glass
Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep

Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professors
More knowledge than Webster dictionary, obituary column plus sign 'em

The jig is up, gut 'em like fish, Swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up, sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers

Soft as cotton candy, we assassins and killers
Let shottie off in club floors, pellets spray your familia
You screaming like you love war

Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying

Half of them passed on, MAC strong, couple of shots
Made the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' they place

To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground, but you
Still standin', still roamin' through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you even now that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you, but behind your back, they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love, it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tear in jail, makin' weapons to kill ya
Weed smoke, three tokes, nigga, pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood, blowin' smoke, state of mind is purple
[Break]
Light it up, light it up, light it up, uhh
Light it up… light it up, light it up, uhh
Uhh… uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh

[Verse 3]
These hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble
Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggas rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward to blow up, so what's the science?
People shoutin', police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in?
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
It's usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide-and-fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
And Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness
Too much of anything'll hurt you, so my state of mind's all purple27Embed"
9.0,Drunk by Myself,The Lost Tapes,2002,"Drunk by Myself Lyrics[Intro]
Uhh, uhh, where am I going
Where am I?
Yo, it's ill

[Verse 1]
Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
MAC in my right arm
Tequila bottle in my left arm, like Christión
Watching my life go
Can't do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, Hell's men
Two revolvers, I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty who wit' me?
My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin'
I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas
Drunk, almost crashed
I'm going too fast
Highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview
If they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me
[Chorus]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 2]
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though
Bullets wake 'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark homey
It's hard to look straight
My foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways
Put out the haze blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in television
Hella women
Jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blasting A/C going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice
[Chorus]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 3]
The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swig
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all
Things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good
Find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib
Tryna see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...
[Chorus]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to

Uhh, yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be telling you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
Know you a young single parent out struggling, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killing shorty future, I wonder how do we last it?
Underground in they casket, ancestors turning
I'm learning something every day, there is no Lazarus
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggas is chilling, getting high, relaxing
Envisioning ownership, yo it can happen
What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give my brother a loan
What do we own? The skin on our backs, we rent and we ask
For reparations, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So stop being controlled, we black zombies
[Chorus]
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, we trapped in our own brain, fucked behind bars
We've already gone insane
We've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
Stab our own backs and dream too much
Without fulfilling reality; too greedy and
Can't have one or two chains, we need three of them
Can't have one or two guns without squeezing 'em
On our own people and, fuck black leaders
'Cause whites ain't got none leading them, the rhythm is cosmic
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophet
Let's all get down and get up
Victims walking 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck
Fainting, shouting, catching Holy Ghost in church
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doing it first
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demonstrated
Just to make another generation - black zombies

[Chorus]
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
[Verse 3]
You scared to be yourself, 'cause you in a trance
Feel free, hear the music and dance
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
Dumb niggas with long beards like they Arabs or Jews
Or from Israel, Bismillah al rahman al rahim
Islam's a beautiful thing
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring
Peace against the darkness, which is ungodly
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
Use your own intuition, you are tomorrow
{*roaring*} .. That's the sound of the beast
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid
Control your own destiny, you are a genius
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie

Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

[Outro:]
Wake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years
Ghetto niggas won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?
Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
When you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it
Do it niggas.. c'mon, uhh, peace...7Embed"

[Intro]
To my nigga
Brought me in this world
Ha, that's right, nigga

[Verse 1]
My ol' dad important to the family structure, provider, a God
My moms a queen, that universal team civilized us
My pops maybe was late, but always came home
My moms would put us to bed, and she would wait on
Soon as he walked in the door, she barking
I turned down the Johnny Carson
Jumped out the bed, we grabbed both his legs
Me and my brother, not knowing the pain he gave my mother
Night after night, fighting, yelling at each other
My poppa played the street all day
Mama was either home or at work
While we playing inside the hall way
She sacrifices all she got to feed us
When she was alone she cried by the phone
Peeping out the window, heated
But still, I didn't see it, mama hid it from us
We was kids, younger, 'til we got bigger, on to
Bigger things, that we knew what the time was
That daddy was leaving his crib and my mom's love
[Chorus]
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""

[Verse 2]
So many kids I knew, never knew who Pop was
That's why I show my pop love
'Cause he was still around when I popped up
He could have left my moms pregnant, shook to death, but stayed
Watched me crawl 'til I took my first step, to the first grade
To my first fistfight, right behind me, he would stand
No matter how big or tall, he made me fight you like a man
Throw dirt in ya eye, swing my right, scoop your ass and slam
He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam
Roaches of weed all over my crib, him and moms relaxing
Next thing you know he packing, so then I asked him
""What's this white shit on that plate and your face?
And, Poppa, why you butt-ass from the waist
And, who's this lady I'm facing?
Dark skin, you not my mommy!""
He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
Promised me things that he would buy me
If I kept my mouth closed and don't tell Mommey
He said one day I'll understand—
""Little me, what's in you is inside me""
[Chorus]
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town (Ugh, my nigga)
""(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down""

[Verse 3]
Pops told me hold my own, Pops told me value home
Could I help it, ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone""?
Who loved the pretty brown round, out-of-town-bound
Trumpet in his jazz band, he touring
At home, I played his latest recordings
And it's strange how I do my thing now, I'm in the game now
Inherited his brainpower, to pull strings and gain power
Our weed habits the same now
No white lines, or trumpets, just tight rhymes
And beats that's bumpin, 'fore he left, he taught me something
A child's young years the most important time to be there
That's why he stayed 'til we grew up, respect is still here
I'm older now, see what having a father's about
One day they can be in your life, next day, they be out
It's not because of you, you know the deal
Him and your moms feel
If they stay together, then someone will get killed
I love you still, always will, 'cause that's my nigga
Although you felt you was wrong, I still feel you, kid
Life goes on...8Embed"
12.0,Fetus,The Lost Tapes,2002,"Fetus Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah..
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore, I could see
Through my belly button window, who I am...

[Verse 1]
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came from behind the sun, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo, developing eyes
Nine-months process, infant size
A prophet in his early stages, mother in her early thirties
Was married to pops, wishing what she carried would drop
I'm not worthy to come from a woman so pure, Ann Jones
Flesh of her flesh, blood of her blood, her blood and bones
Hearing prayers, she asking for my good health
That I'd become a man and learn to make a way for myself
Nervous she was, and her paranoia got in my blood
Mixed with marijuana from my daddy's genes
Lot of screams I'm hearing, it's crazy, both parents is scrapping
I'm not even a baby, a miscarriage could happen
[Chorus]
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes

[Verse 2]
Yo, they must wanna keep me, 'cause four months pass, I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an Ill Will to survive
When I look hard, the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms layin down, I get bored, start to get live
Move side to side, hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food flowing through my mother's tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me, but month three was closer, see
That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered, ""If I am born, will I be safe at all?""
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month five, month six went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
September 14th, 73
Get ready, world, doctor's in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gon' stop
See how the government start retraining cops
Month nine, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said ""Stay calm,"" holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything is blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face, he's so proud
Wanting to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he say, ""At least that nigga ain't ugly""
Placed me in his arms snugly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body, she loved me
And yo, I plan to overthrow the Devil
And y'all bout to see this world in trouble, motherfuckers

Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
""What you up to? The cops gon' bust you.""
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, ""Nobody leavin'
Everybody—""

Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play.""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded ""cool,"" but told me out here this how motherfuckers—

Noisy I aim, not silently, noose all surroundin' me
I hang 'em, I string 'em up, ain't no thing, I just drop 'em
To which doctor you copped
And you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit, it's hard to see R&B
Rappers arguably, started fuckin' up the game horribly
'Cause I parted the sea, then these novices targeted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin' to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin' to be
The next me, yeah I support him, but he's blinded I see
Jealousy, he love me to death and I'm buggin'
I love him for life, we both still mournin' on our mother's life
And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass
With the Nasty Nas diary, get out my path

I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses

I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses

I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

I can't keep a bitch 'cause none of them come before little Des
I can't be too rich, too many hoes lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggas in houses with pretty mazes
Water and flowers in 'em
While my niggas walk around in they trousers grinnin'
Gotta keep a lot of heat; .30 cals, 10 millimeters
.40 cals plus the Heckler to set y'all straight
You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? The infrared show you what the TEC about
Huh? I'm stressin' out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks who mad greedy
We can sell mo' boats on the coast
Give coats to the po', and give hope to the broke, then live low
But that ain't reality; I look happy, but under the sky
You see a nigga who know, out of three women two out of three
Will love you but lead you to they own hidden evil
Bitch! You the reason niggas be beefin', ho get on

Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey

Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out

Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid

Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest

And I like a little sassiness
A lot of class; Mami, reach in your bag, pass the fifth
I'm a leader at last, this a don you with

4.0,Last Real Nigga Alive,God’s Son,2002,"Last Real Nigga Alive Lyrics[Intro]
Uhh, uhh, uhh

[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through (uhh)
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
[Verse 1]
Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars
Who you thought Kick in the Door was for?
But that's my heart, y'all still trippin' off the Jigga shit
Real niggas listen up and I'ma tell you how the whole thing start
Off top I brung Queens up from hard times
Rockin' at the Fever, streets was all mine
It was my version of the blues, droppin' out schools
The crack epidemic had rap representin' new rules
So I got in them shoes, tried 'em, wore them
Wasn't a perfect fit so I couldn't sport 'em
Young murderers ride, I knew all them
Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warrin'
I wrote it in my album
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island, and Lord held me down and
My surroundings started changin', I had a baby
I was makin' my rounds with AZ
Niggas started noticin' my flow and was open when
The Golden Child closed 'em in
With more style than them older men
Puff tried to start a label, Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang
Snoop and Dre had a new thing
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects
He let me drive it, before Ready to Die hit
Big and I hit blunts performin' at the Ark
Next thing you knew, Big blew and all the ballin' starts
He had Kim in his crew, I found Fox
Only niggas in New York with number one charts
Big was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon
My niggas, but dig it, they couldn't get along
That's when Ghostface said it on The Purple Tape
Bad Boy bitin' Nas album cover, wait
Big told me Rae was stealin' my slang
And Rae told me, out in Shaolin, Big would do the same thing
But I borrowed from both them niggas
Jigga started to flow like us, but hit with ""Ain't No Niggas""
Had much Versace swagger
Big admired the Brooklynite and took him in as Iceberg the rapper
Today, don't know nothin' about this boss shit
There's more shit than wantin' to be this King of New York shit
Uhh, uhh, uhh
[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu (uhh)
Look at the life that I've been through (yeah)
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

[Verse 2]
Rap became a version of Malcolm and Martin
Rest in peace Will, Queensbridge live on
There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song
There's some missing pieces I had to leave out
Had lost trust for Steve Stoute at some point 'til I got to know him
We old friends, but what's loyal?
Puff soaked Interscope offices with champagne bottles on Steve
And Steve thought the drama's on me
'Cause previously it would've been, against whoever
Friends forever
However, I learned, with some niggas it's all business
But I'm a street dude with morals
Then this nigga's with Jigga too much
He used to say Jay wanted my spot
I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot
A quiet man who used to be alone plannin'
Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it
She hit the streets, later on she hittin' the sheets
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinkin' he strong
I taught her how to watch for cars who might follow
Taught her street shit that I know
Her weakness was shine yo
But that's her, I ain't mad, baby, it made me stronger
Now I get my paper longer
Illmatic I was boss, It Was Written I flossed
One of the most creative LP's ever to hit stores
In The Firm I learned I Am NAStradamus
QB's Finest, Oochie Wally, faced more problems
I gave it all up so I can chill at home with Mama
She was gettin' old and sick so I stayed beside her
We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs
I told her not 'til I see her health get more strong
In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack
Assassinate my character, degrade my hood
'Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go
The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood
What y'all want, see, I already had
The Gift and The Curse? Fuck that shit, the first you'll be last
I'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper
G-O-D, S-O-N – they'll be none after
I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo
It hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo...
Uhh, uhh, uhh
[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu

Tuck in your chain put your watch in your pocket
Here come the Braveheart straight out the projects
We live the life where the blood spills
Same thing that get you cash nigga, get you killed
Warnin', Jungle always keep a gun on him
Pull out, brrrrrrrt, forehead yawning
Sloppy, droppin' you birds
Close range so my bullets don't swerve, curve
No bullshit, back in ya head, find me
Call Earl, death is the ways of the world
Y'all made criminals tryin' to wild out there sold crack
Bust guns at Bow Wow's age
Fightin' in jail, lookin' for heaven, livin' in hell
Fuckin 'em hoes, boilin' coke since I was 12
Way too foul walk around all the time
With a gray MAC-10 and a pocket full o' dimes
[Verse 2: Wiz]
Braveheart to the graveyard, let's go niggas
Scared straight, but FUCK them hoes
Keep it, dead serious
Believe it don't believe us, until you see me creepin'
Now you sleep with them fishes

To all them ghetto and sober bitches in 'burban districts
I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son
And this is the military turn it up
My Uzi weighs a ton, your son less thump nah
Heat talk feet walk you run uh

Na I'm lyin', who gives a fuck that's so tired
While pictures of Bravehearts just livin' it up
A million of us, each nigga inchin' to bust
You got a house in Virginia, the only way you sicker than us
Gettin' bagged with .22's now you's a ridiculous fuck
No need for the gun play, it's okay, 'cause you dyin' anyway
[Verse 4: Jungle]
Yo, this is for them high school drop outs
Niggas who copped out
If you prefer shots over knockouts
Sniffin' coke, smokin' weed
Sellin' crack, sellin' smack
You thuggin' it, you ain't turn it back
Bravehearts gettin' money ruthless 'till the world end
Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend
I used to have a bike on a bench
Now I got the Jeep on this trip
Coke in the pot, heat on my hip

[Verse 5: Wiz]
Nigga don't stop blazin' 'cause ya target's movin'
Shoot 'til the gun's empty stupid, Queens
Niggas so ruthless, really excuses is
Useless to these swift executioners

6.0,Hey Nas,God’s Son,2002,"Hey Nas Lyrics[Verse 1: Nas]
The phone rings
Another peaceful moment is lost
Latifah's chest jingle in Set It Off
I press pause in the bed as a king
I let it ring 4 or 5 times
Answer while I'm puffin' my green
It's Tamika sayin', ""Hi Nas""
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that
She offered me dinner under the moon
I said, ""Sorry I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room""
Nine push-ups, strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up
The pimp's gone off the Patron Tequila
Put on my Lee's and the original Filas
Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tels
Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go
Heads turn it's a freak show
I need them to know, when will they learn
Nas need a queen not a ho to
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick, someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies
And you can sing along 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy
[Chorus: Claudette Ortiz]
Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

[Verse 2: Nas]
One for the honies who roll blunts up but don't smoke
Two for the few who see potential in you when you broke
Three for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you
Double life wife, play with the man that's livin' with you
Here's the issue, a woman gotta be stunnin'
Get to a man's heart through his stomach
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart
Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok
If you want barbecue I call Professor and Ak
'Cause you point out my enemies, someone who's into me
But not a hyper chick- someone with the proper energy
A girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you could be the one 'cause I'm lovin' ya energy

[Chorus: Kelis]
Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow
[Verse 3: Nas]
Slow is the way
Holdin' hands, tongue and hickeys
Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me
That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there
Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years
Like no one else in the world did this except for us two
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'
As we suck and fuck each other's minds out commission
Time's out forbidden
Until we pass out, that's when we stop
We give it all we got, give it all we got- we hot
Give it all we got, give it all we got- we rock
Give it all we got, give it all we got
You 'bout the baddest thing
Since Michael had Billie Jean
And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls
But to be my queen you must...
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick, someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you can be the one 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

7.0,I Can,God’s Son,2002,"I Can Lyrics[Intro: Children's Choir]
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 1]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow
[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this
[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 3]
Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen""
[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes
Right on the spot in the studio soon as I hear the track
You know what I'm sayin'?
Word, but I wanted to bring
A couple of books to the studio today, man
I found these shits up in the crib, man, in boxes, man
I don't even remember when I was writin' these shits
Or what's in these shits, man
Probably a bunch of bullshit, man… fuck it, check it
[Verse 1]
How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man, a O.G.
Some niggas will conversate with liars all day
Time pass— (Nah, let me start somethin' else)
Soul on ice, death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed, cursed, worse I been blessed first
I thought I was abnormal
‘Cause I would overcome any tasked called to
So there it is, I'm a prince, I'm against lames
Who do minor shit, swear they on the top of they game
Your rhymin' is called ""Vagina Monologue,"" it kinda supports
Theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue
Rarely y'all come in contact with the real
Since Pun passed, he was the last shine of sun I could feel
Yo, said there's a few left since music's expressions of life

Numbers is big business, makes the poor live trife
The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream
Through your existence become wealthy, knowledge is king
Pimps and card sharks, thiefs, murderers with hard luck
Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety
Grow up watchin' well-dressed niggas with charms
Beautiful ladies on their arms
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas
Rubbin' my lips with Campophenique
Still behind the ears wet, turned out to be
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers, crack sellers, and liars and squares
(Nah, that was weak there)
My people be projects or jail, never Harvard or Yale
Pardon me type in my two-way while I'm chargin' my cell
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci, God, poverty's real

I want you to close your eyes
And vision the most beautiful place in the world
If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey, the best journey
A mansion, acres of land and swimming pools and all that
Check it out

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings
To fly like doves over the streets, watchin' many things
Kids walkin' home from school on drug blocks
Missionaries pass out papers that read ""Love God""
I see faces, cases, judges, and juries, Masons, lawyers and cops
I watch because every thug's face is my mirror
But this was one in particular
This kid, he was the vintage stick 'em up pro
Sixteen years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go
Every morning, calls his comrade to come and get him to smoke
He insane, already gone mad blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where it sets at
Slang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
Chasin' him, his asthma's flarin'
Smokin' like a chimney, on Remy, of course he not carin'
He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'
I give him a helping hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion
[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in Thugz Mansion
[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

[Verse 3: Nas]
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's momma to cry
See, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just twenty-some-odd years
I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy
I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar with golden wings in Thugz Mansion
[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy

In case y'all niggas got to get murdered
(A mastermind) sleeps at night real easy

Lives forever, these tales are classical

Velvet bow ties
Bulletproof's in the tux, when I roll by
In a car similar to Osama's, in my diamonds
And my principal is to study drama
Look what happened in Manhattan
A couple of, years ago when guns started clappin'
Two of my dogs fell, two of my niggas ran
They was amateurs in beef with a grown man
It taught me the lessons of how the strong stand
And how the weak end up in a coffin
Play it cool, that's the old school rule, man
Keep your ears to the street, you'll never lose, man
Make your enemies believe there's love there
'Cause in war, belief is all fair
Rock them to sleep, shots in your Jeep
And you ain't never know the plot was from me
It's from my masterminds

It ain't a game it's the life
Think it's a game, you lame
And I'm nice on that black stone Merlot
Toast to my hero Nat Turner
Weather below zero, gave the keys to Kelis
Whispered in her earlobe, ""drive home""
'Cause she the wife and they the freaks
The underneath my girl caliber
They smiled at her and said ""Goodbye""
With niggas who thug or die, they wild as us
My bodyguards in my Denali truck
Knowing that I'm surrounded by OGs
That I don't really get down with
They got a separate table for their freaks bought them drinks
So we could talk man-to-man so real niggas could link
I knew, they kill hoes too like Rae Carruth
They used to spray troops, now they managing groups
The main nigga Sonny had big money since '82
Had two of my dogs whacked, nothing I could do
That was back when I had no crew, I switched that
Now I'm strong with niggas who feel Sonny was wrong
My money's long, his money is weak, he's losing sleep
Trying to feel me out, to see what it's gon' be
But I'm a mastermind
[Chorus]
(A mastermind) sees it coming before it comes
(A mastermind) before he go to war he counts his ones
(A mastermind) everything planned out perfect
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered
(A mastermind) sleeps at night real easy
(A mastermind) 'cause everything he does is by the book
(A mastermind) never do a thing irrational
Lives forever, these tales are classical

[Verse 3]
I live a clean life, I don't even steal cable
I speak for myself, my niggas'll slay you
Lucky us, this rap done worked out fine
Feds, check me out, it's no dirt y'all find
This King of New York shit only last 15 minutes
Every nigga get burned, but it's what you did with it
Niggas who brilliant, came in and killed it
Made millions every three months, new jury
I'm low, smoking Blueberry with a ho
That know a few scary individuals, it's eerie as she get into it
Squares, they into voodoo
She says a Hail Mary, then she said she knew who
Would come and try to kill you too

[Chorus]
(A mastermind) sees it coming before it comes
(A mastermind) before he go to war he counts his ones
(A mastermind) everything planned out perfect
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered

Uh, if I can teach somethin' so be it
And hope somebody learn somethin' from it
And give it back

[Verse 1: Nas & Both]
They can't break me or shake me
They too fake to come kill me
Think they faith is with Satan
They mistake me I'm filthy
Rich off the ghetto medleys, so now they wanna dare me
It's gonna be a murder confront me, the burners are empty
Middle Passage I made it
I'm from the land of David
The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets
Y'all bunch of backward gangsters
Y'all signin affidavits
Snitches with smiling faces, got you blowin trial, I hate this
Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy
I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried
Kind of weird and it's scary
All my years have prepared me
What I fear is my temper, I see clear to the center
Right through a man's soul
Straight through his eyes, straight to his heart
I'm still alive, how did I make it this far?
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way, uhh
[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

[Verse 2: Nas]
Like King Nasir fightin' the British regime
I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost and they broke
Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket
Your mother's the closest thing to God that you ever have kid
I'm askin', what would you do at your own mom's funeral
Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep still
I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to body somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a hold

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum
[Verse 3: Nas & Both]
Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful
If you was me all this pain I'm feelin' would bend and killed you (I'm a warrior)
It only made me stronger
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya
Sometimes I wish I was dead
But I took heed to the cause (I'm a warrior, yeah)
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way, uhh

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Nas]
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior) to my warriors
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Warriors, baby, KrucialKeys! Braveheart y'all
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

[Outro: Nas]
This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion
To everybody that lost their mother, their father
Rest in peace moms!
My mother's last words: Never give up
A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war
Love ya girl, y'know keep marchin'
Yeah yeah yeah, you never give up
To all my warriors, haha

(Uh uh huh, lets go, yeah!)
Uh, ghetto children singing (singing, what up?)
See they eager to learn (uh hum)
How to become the next world leaders, Bravehearts

[Chorus: Nas]
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
[Verse 1: Nas]
Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness
In all them, gotta shoot only if necessary
Homie vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
When Aryan nations ain't having integration
We so blind, the beauty of life
Was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right
""Jesus"", what is he like?
I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school
Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Gandhi was a fool
The chronic's a fool, got me thinking out loud, fuck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out

[Chorus: Nas]
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
[Verse 2: Lake]
My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's
I build with dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill in Dix Hills
For fishscale, to cop guns, the time come
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus
Fuck the beef, I'll snatch your seed from Chuckie Cheese
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's
Black fatigues and AR-15s on the sofa
50 inch flat screen, Louie Vuitton holsters
My motions don't appeal to appellate divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler
Black gorilla, Crip and Blood in one nigga
Only killers know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake
Though simultaneously the street revolution
21 gun salute the new Huey Newton

[Chorus: Nas]
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here

[Verse 3: Nas & Lake]
Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to it's fathers
Protect the children, grab revolvers
The women plays important part of our life force
So what we fight for, my heart goes to you, beautiful wife in war
Uh, and listen more and talk less
Watch all and trust none, demand your respect
And be ready to die for what you believe in
And ride all the time not just when convenient
Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding
We the lost children of Israel in this western world region
You ain't a man, you a coward if you can't support the girl you put a seed in
Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong
It's more to a war than just getting it on
Conceal your form, cover your tracks, stay prepared
I don't care if no one's spared in..
[Chorus: Nas]
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war

One more time, one more time
Uh, one more time
Uh, one more time

[Verse 1]
I dream of the day I can go back to when I was born
Layin' in your arms, wishin' you was here today, Mom
Wish you'd appear, just for a second from Heaven
My tears would be gone, I wouldn't be rappin' this song
I'd be happy drivin' up to your eight-bedroom mansion
Up late, laughin' about the hard times we faced
The galaxy is so enchantin' beyond, Galileo's understandin'
Past the Milky Way and all the planets
There's somethin' out there greater, but only God knows
Scientists claim we came from apes, but they lies though
That was part of our conversation
I spark one up and start blazin'
Thinkin' of how amazin' she was, an angel gave me love
I'm thankful to ever know a woman so real
I pray, when I marry, my wife'll have one of your skills
But Mom, you could never be replaced
I'd give my life up just to see you one more day, to have—
[Chorus]
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma
Praying, wishing that I could have
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma

[Verse 2]
I wish you were here, I miss you more each second I breathe
You resting in peace, forever, I accepted you free
A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white
Smilin' at me, happy, knowin' everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter
Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine
April 7th '02, that's when the gates of Heaven opened up
For you to stroll through, beautiful Anne Jones
Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on, and now I'm good
Job well done, you lived through your sons and grandchildren
Jesus finally got his bride, Mommy, dance with him!
And you've been my guide through all the trouble I faced
They playin' our song, the life-beat, my hand on your waist
I grab your other hand, I'm tryin' not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed, dreaming I can have—
[Chorus]
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma
Praying, wishing that I could have
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma

If Heaven was a mile away
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
If Heaven was a mile away
Or save it all for you?
If Heaven was a mile away
Would I fill the tank up, put gas
And be out the front door in a (flash?)
Before reconsidering this hell with you
It ain't you, it's the things you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would've fell with you, to Hell with you
[Verse 1: Nas]
If Heaven was a mile away, and you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens
Would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder, finally believe in His power?
Even if you couldn't see Him, but you could feel Him
Would you still doubt Him?
How would you start actin'?
Would you try to put the keys down, thinkin' every drug sale that you make in the streets he can see now?
Would a fiend even want to get high? Would he stop smokin'
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in?
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for a atheist
It's hard takin' this, racist planet
Where they take a younger brother in a hand-cuff
Even if he innocent, ""Nigga, get on the car!
Put your motherfuckin' hands up!""
Thinkin' I'ma lose it, my mom's in chemo
Three times a week yo, keep tryin', but people, it's hard
And God, your young soldier's not sober but needs you
This world's my home, but world, I will leave you

Nigga, what you think, I'ma stop building?
I'ma stop feelin' like I'm Amistad's great-great-grandchildren?
How I'm not gonna want to make millions
Since the quarter water days, in the hallways
Makin' fake gold caps
With the Reese's Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while
That same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time took 'em cats, never looked back
Cristal, blowin' dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me: you see, the broads and Bentleys
Is nothin' unless my niggas spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all about some new kicks
Free of any autographs, and not to be recognized, forgive me
It's becomin' unbearable, makin' hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on a hook, there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise, preachers touchin' on alter boys
Sodomizin', not realizin' God is watchin', before the Lord
How could they do the Devil's work?
A man give another man head in Church
Hell, it hurts just to fathom the thought, wishin' that I fled the Earth

Yeah, we all in the grind
But look at the beautiful shit around you, it's a beautiful life
All my niggas locked up, keep ya heads up
Heaven's just a mile away
I'm talkin' Heaven on Earth, ain't got nothin' to do with money
Got nothin' to do with nothin' material

Yo, my man was regulatin' on niggas he used to thug with
Older niggas in this murder game, drug czars
BM, Jaguars, they cash was large
Since he was wild, they let him in
He did a crazy number of things
To put himself deeper under they wing
It didn't take long for duke to get on
Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong
Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin'
Drivin' they cars, robbin connects
Drivin' his Lex, keys was movin'
Young don, now they know they weakness
They never seen it comin'
Son was on some real take over the streets shit
Now he got his own crew of young guns clickin' now
Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?
[Verse 2]
Dudes be, comin' from bids thinkin shit is different
'Cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it
I just sit back and, think of my last 20 years
6 pack, gunnin' my years, jet black, blunt in my ear
Real relaxed, readin' real loves stories like
Caesar and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her
'Cause Liz Taylor's hot, but the Egyptian queen
On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil
Baby powder, night owl, movin' to later hours, only
Fuckin' with kings, niggas official
If you phony, come in the circle, niggas'll diss you
We converse on the state of hip hop
We share the same views and feelings
He sling 'caine, crib costin' 2 million
He plan to leave the streets forever
But niggas that wanted him left him
Dead in the streets 'fore I can tell himEmbed"

Pussy killed me when I was born (What?)
Pardon me, I'll rephrase it: departed mommy's womb decaying
I look at the bright side
The fact that I got a life side
Born '73 - September right Nas? (True)
Virgo child, the first thing I learn is money makes the world go round
On this small planet, it's ten women to one man; I wonder how we manage
To say vows and walk a straight line in marriage
Niggas is some nasty creatures (word)
Bitches even nastier, they throw at your boy and it's hard for me to pass it up
Freaky hoes lick a nigga's ass and nuts
Stupid bitch bragging 'til her baby dad went nuts (stupid bitch)
Now he looking for me, two cars deep
Rolling up on nigga's, barrel out the window, asking, ""You Nas peeps?""
I can't have that, two four five, nigga grab that
Pass it to me, sucker-for-love niggas I blast at
I swear my dick is gonna get me in trouble
I pissing bubbles
I thought I felt a sharp pain, better stick to rubbers
When laying hooker after hooker, day out and day in
Watch out for diseases, the doctors can't name 'em
Just a thought: we all fuck the same chicks
Some play like they innocent, fucking entertainers
And basketball players, the bitch is a ho
But still some of y'all a save her, put your dick in her throat
You just the nigga that done wifed her (huh?)
She drove you crazy, now your monkey ass wanna shoot the pimp that pipes her
She had your baby, (damn) now you a life-er
And suicide notes you write her, pussy kills

Oh what a thrill
Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real
Pussy kills
Backs shots keep a nigga open
Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking
Huh, pussy kills

Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real

My nigga James got married, same girl he went to school with
Nice girl, nerd with glasses, he was too stuck
Studied for her Masters, part time nurse
I'll tell you how superb the ass is, but who's looking
I mean that's my man, maybe I just took a peek
Maybe I wondered what it would be like, sike
'Cause James and me like I was with AZ like
Luke and Han Solo
Fucking with niggas' girls' forbidden, that's a no-no
It's death and we real niggas, civilized Gods
And their ain't too many niggas like Nas, I'm trust worthy
Plus I know a dude that caught his wife cheating
Killed his baby, killed his wife, and took his own life, even
Happy for James 'cause real bitches hard to come by
This nigga found one, I told him he's lucky, we clown some
Rolling up dutchies while watching Roy Jones in round one, he froze
Put his face to the TV, 'bout an inch close
Move out the way nigga, fuck's the matter with you, you blind?
He pointed to the front row, thought he was loosing his mind
She 'posed to be with her sick mother, left for the weekend
Was stressed when she was leaving
Now she's next to some nigga, cheesing
He's having trouble breathing (gasping for air, coughing)
He pictured 'em making noises, grinding him and kissing him
Yelling, ""Ain't no telling where her lips have been!""
Left her foul messages, she came home no lesser than
Ten minutes later, then they start wrestling and screaming
She said she missed her flight that evening
She never left, she wasn't at that fight, you speeding
That's Vegas, this is New York, you bugging
I held up my hand for a dap but he wouldn't touch it
I'm like, ""When you started acting like that? This is dumbness.""
Gave me a crazy look and started swinging punches
I ducked, couldn't believe it, the nigga so whipped
He got his gat and started squeezing, hit two policemen
Neighbors dialed 911, they heard the thumping
Wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumping
Me and his wife dip to the floor she smiled strange
My comrade was breathing no more, they killed James

Oh what a thrill
Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real

1.0,Intro,Street’s Disciple,2004,"Intro Lyrics[Nas]
Peace, how are you?
I ain't mean to be late
It was my night to watch my little girl
It's chilly out here
What happened? You crying?
Y'all got into it again huh?
See you gotta let them know from the jump
I don't care who they are, or who they're with
Yeah I know they know we're talking
Shh, why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us
Could love each other
Come on, stop crying now
Oh, there's something I gotta tell you
I heard they're watching you
Yeah, they're watching, they're watching me too
But there ain't no reason to get low
I'm proud, I'm here
You know I'ma stand up for you, no matter what
And I know you'll stand up for me
I don't have no doubts about you being true to me
The world is ours
But right now it feels like the whole world is against us
So study, be strong, don't cry no more

Get ready, get prepared
This is prophecy
God is with us!

[Verse 1]
I walk the blocks like whatever god, my message to y'all feds
Who desperate to arrest us young, benevolent hardheads
Abercrombie & Fitch rockin', wrist glistenin' marksman
Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed
The project logic is still salute the dead, Glocks spit
Pour some juice out for those in Manchester, Beaumount
Otisville, Lewisberg, Fort Dix, Fort Worth, Oakdale
Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk
War hurts much to gain 'til the day we all say
May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away
At our enemies, may they die easily
Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me
Blowin' greenery, growing eager to see evil things
Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans
Airs and Chucks, solitaires, stones with the rarest cuts
On some Pretty Tone shit, haircut looks airbrushed
And they're aware of us though
And we don't give a flyin' 747 fuck though
Stayin' on my hustle
*beat change*

[Verse 2]
A message to those who trapped us up
From federal guys who backed them up
We never will die, we black and tough
Lead in your eye, we strapped to bust
Half of us been locked up inside the beast
Look at the time we see
Brooklyn to Compton streets, Queens
Even the Congo needs dreams
Our bullets and triggers our enemies
Pullin' on innocent women and children
It wasn't no ghetto killers
Who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings
But I'm not gon' cry and I'm not gon' stand, just watch you die
I'ma pass you a .9, I'ma grab your hand
Come on let's ride
A message to those who killed the king
Who murdered the Christ, the same regime
What God has built, you never can break
What God has loved, you never can hate
Man makes rules and laws
You just a ruthless dog, your kennel is waiting
You devils will run back into the caves you came from
Whenever that day comes, forty acres
Plantations, see every race won
Sincerely yours, Street's Disciple, revelations6Embed"
3.0,Nazareth Savage,Street’s Disciple,2004,"Nazareth Savage Lyrics*Man laughing*

[Verse 1: Nas]
I had bad chicks that blow cum bubbles like bubblegum
Plus they ass lick, summer house be sippin' rum
Layin' lazy in the recliner, couple days
In my ashtray, smoke signals from the haze
I stick my finger through it, the ring of smoke broke
That symbolize weak guys, pop the strong link off
The infrastructure caves in, amazin'
I ain't have to read The Art of War to slay men
Serve niggas, bird niggas speakin' reckless
When their momma love the kid's records I made
You gutless, you don't know struggle
Throw a couple shells at you, hell grabs you
Nail stabs a hand of the Nasirine
I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen
Gave you chumps a path to walk, hold my hand
I'ma guide you like a O.G. but don't talk, don't get it confused
Cause none of y'all can fit in my shoes
Y'all made of chemicals, artificial actions
God'll forgive you bastards
Only if you repent to the Nazareth Savage
[Verse 2: Nas]
I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the puss, get it?
Form a crew, swallow forty cal. bullets after dinner's finished
Wash it down with a shot of tequila, pocket full of scrilla
Can't come close to, Francis Coppola, Samson -- no Delilah
You're pint-sized, I'm Mike's eyes with the gladiator tattoos on it
You scared to look too long at, sit on a don's lap
Tell you a story shorty, spicy like Lawry's
Chicken-heads and orgies, criminals that draw heat in their late forties
Drug habits, love grabbin' kids up like yours
Sendin' you a picture of them in their drawers with black eyes
Savage guys, you hire Magnum PI's to bag up my guys
Said you was a thug with a good disguise, try to protect your cabbage
You're runnin' from the Nazareth Savage

[Verse 3: Nas]
Son's back with flows, they say mine is very scary
Smell fear like a canine that finds buried babies
And all of y'all wear that same aroma
How to blow on your eighth LP, I'll show ya
You're wack nigga, face it
In the history of the game, you have no placement
Liquor and weed just massacred their mind, or thee celebrity
Or they couldn't change with time, so now they run they mouth
But when the sun go south, them guns come out
My cavalry woulda been through ten in your skin
Casualty you don't wanna be, don't want it with me

4.0,American Way,Street’s Disciple,2004,"American Way Lyrics{'Political'}

Newscaster: ""Recently there has been an emergence of socially
Conscious and political rappers. It seems to be
A new trend in the Hip-Hop world.""
*DJ scratches sample* {'Nas is a rebel to America!'}3X*
(Yeah, check it, uh)

[Vers 1: Nas]
Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa
Beard little longer, feel strong and I'll stop ya
Drill sergeant, still thorough wheelbarrows of distilled vodka
Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?
You ain't got the ghetto with you
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh
We ain't got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice, I don't really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she
Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MCs, gotta give 'em the rules
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey
You MCs on that old slavery path
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh
See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells
It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win
Need somebody from the hood as my councilman, uh
[Hook: Kelis]
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit

[Verse 2: Nas]
Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin
Israeli men conversatin' on ends
Probably businessmen, I sense good taste
And they watch us, the spots an expensive place
Manhattan New York, I'm tryna keep steamin'
It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening
This man leans in, his boys laughing
Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens
Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or a black ho
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most women who love Givenchy or Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve the Hermes purse
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh
[Hook: Kelis]
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit

[Verse 3: Kelis]
I don't care about the runaways, I don't care about who's gay
I don't care about dying of AIDS, but I care if I got paid
Who even cares about the president?
I think we're making a mistake
I don't care about the hurricane as long as my family's safe
I don't care about the candidates, they burnt this country to bits
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way (Nas: Uh)

[Kelis]
Can we make a change, you know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: And ya don't stop, uh)
Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: Yeah)

Let's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB
Who 'Yes Massa' on TV
What ever happened to Wheezy? The Redd Foxx's?
Never got Emmy's but were real to me
Let's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels
Cause they said they played they parts well
Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail
Lambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel
Whitey always tell him, ""Ooh, he speak so well""
Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro?
The acceptable Negro? Hell nah
But they say ""These are our heroes""
[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play
Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud
But there's somethin' they don't say
Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay
From OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe
First he played his life cool just like Michael
Now he rock ice too just like I do
Yo, you can't do better than that?
The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?
Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back
Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you
You turn around then you shit on Shaq
Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes
He love a little butt crack, got enough cash
Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you
To do something for the youth, stupid spoof
But you let them use you as an example
They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full

You Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles
But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through
But what's your excuse, duke? You talk Black
But your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque
You don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface
You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe
Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it
Huh, and in the end we all got dicked
These are our heroes, thanks a lot, public school systems still rot
Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks
Sellin they peoples out, some real folks with clout
Tavis Smiley, Michael Eric Dyson
Stokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them
Nicky Giovanni poetical black female
Jim Brown to the people who sing well from
Fela to Miriam Makeba
The mirror says you are the next American leader
So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records
These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records
Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC
But next year, who knows what we'll see?
Ha-ha... these are our heroes

Uh, I knew a few pharmacists, fuck frozen
They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists
The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit
Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car
All red Ferrari, Florida where we met at a redlight
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
Piled in behind him, limosine, Benz
He shouted, ""Nas, roll with us""
I'm bored so I followed him
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins
He put me on to Dawn, nice ass with a set of mean twins
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove
War stories about dudes both of us know
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow
A year go by, the nigga was fly
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
Got a call, he's in N.Y
Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by
For a season where he's at
Greets me with a smile, told him ""Here keep that""
Next week got a call from his wife
Said somebody done took son life
*beat changes*
She said
[Nas as Scarlett - repeat 2X]
""Who gon' hold me down now? Hold me down now
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now?
Who gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down?
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now""

[Nas as Scarlett]
Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude
Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou
H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road
Left him there on Biscayne, clothes stained with his brain
My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up
Arrangement's a closed casket
See now a ho has to, maintain with his fake gang
Sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it
Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Hatian, half Asian
Brag about how the streets needed a changin'
Son, you the only one a bitch could call
You remind me of my dude, help me get them all

[Nas]
Picture my last days will be so grim
My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me
Eyes dilated, looking skinny, trying to smile, trying to say something
Whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words
Tears fall down my facial, why fear anything, it's now too late to
I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career
But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts
I would hit the scene for a second and bounce
Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick
Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it
Sex, I shot pearl necklaces on necks and tits
Traveled half the world, wish I traveled the rest of it
From QB to Mecca kid, so if you knew me
You'd be proud to say I left you with enough memories to resurrect me with
So live now nigga

It's been a long time since you came through to see ya sis
You know I love you, I've been a fan since Genesis
God, I respect you cause you never tried to smash
Since we met a while back, and your style was mack
Now I see that you a man after all you been through
A stand-up dude, held me down after Sekou
Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could
But the white cells in my blood were no good
Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier
I thought, ""Me a victim?"", could never be my character
It's ill Se' passed the way he did, didn't know how to tell him
Just happy it didn't get in our kid
But all the things I did was the flyest, experiences were priceless
Remember days of diamond cuts
Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars
Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize
I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards
Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs
To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor
Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules
All the planes I flew, niggas I ran through
Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from
Grimy niggas, rich niggas, damn it ain't a game son
From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands
Gucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces
Critics and fans, they need to get a life
You doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now
I grew with you so you know you make me proud
And most of all you gotta live now
[Hook: Scarlett]
Live now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, keep spending
Not under the ground yet, keep enjoying every minute yo
Gotta live it up to the limit yo
Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro

Overthrow king from they thrones cause of their negligence
Death, real shit'll start comin' to light
Niggas you ain't like dickin' your wife, what?
Kind of undermining, grimy, stiff corpse shapin'
Pork bacon, double-cross Satan

But glory go to God, y'all beneath him
If y'all don't know that, rap with a old cat
He'll show you streets where them big dealers drove at
Where low-key killers let the fo' clap
Blocka-blocka-blocka—oh
The glow, the 'dro, the dough for shows
Everything a hood brother think he needs—yo
You'll find a goal in a ghetto superstar's roadmap
And I'ma use that for the—

So I had to learn how to turn around a hundred thou' real fast
In '95 that was my last
I went back to the ave thinkin' rap's a thing of the past
Rest in peace E Money Bags
No more cabs, got caught with the ratchet in the stash
Lawyer want cash, my ba'y bro blast burners at cats who gel
They burnt a range with a Molotov cocktail
My little man got fourteen-years for car-jackin' a undercover
Them cops swear, my little nigga told on me
I'm thinkin', ""Hello, where's the L-O-V-E""
Pigs play games, my little man'll never say names
Word to his pops with elephant veins
They both locked-up still, word to Will
I'll make it and chill for the—

So she wouldn't hit the block all crazy for the smoke
Damn, nigga, could you picture you supplyin' your own moms
So she don't have to bone for dimes?
Or give dome for nicks' in the roof of the projects
Where dogs shit and piss
Yeah, we all plan to get rich but it's all about how it's executed
Lexus coup-ed, baguettes from cubics
Might've been stupid, but I got far from twenty-six bars
To ten LPs
What can him tell me? Of them? Of y'all?
I'm Nas—on a track that's unorthodox
Like my life could've been offed by the cops
Told y'all, Nas will prevail by the book when it's up for sale
About the rest—

[Verse 1: Quan]
Can we please have a moment of silence
That's for my niggas doing years in confinement
And for my soldiers that passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor
Symobolizing let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep til slugs kill us here
This for my dogs, stuck in the struggle trying to gain
Smoking trauma, sniffing Ra while selling cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowing how to stop and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Blooding and thugging, folking and loking
Criping and creeping, Latin and Kinging
Or just for poor righteous teaching
[Hook x2: Quan]
As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yeah and can we have another moment of silence
For brothers who died from Black-on-Black violence
From here to the Dark Continent where rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dying
And can we please pour some more liquors
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy my niggas
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhyming Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hoping that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishing I was there with you
Let's take 'em home

[Hook x2: Quan]
As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home
[Verse 3: Quan]
And can we please have a moment to mourn
For Pac, Biggie and Pun, 'cause through us they live on
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah and Aaliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we hope to see ya
Can we please have a moment for children
Who got raped or murdered or trapped in the system
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
Busting her ass to give her kids shit she never had
For my niggas in the pen hoping rhymes'll get 'em signed
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
For every mother that held a son in the street bleeding
Crying a song of sorrow to dark and deep for speaking
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle
To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em

As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?

[Verse 1: Nas]
By the time of age nine I'm already decidin'
If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'
Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one
By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment
And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects
Watchin' them older niggas pass pot and they high man
I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy
Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me
So I would go to school and try to get good grades
Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids
So she cussed them, said ""My son ain't no motherfuckin' hoodlum""
They judged us, thinking that we dumb cause where we come from
Got a little older and now I see
Young niggas wanted by the powers that be (powers that be)
[Hook: Emily]
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
For these wars we're fighting with each other
Season after season
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave
She never had it, it's not hers to begin with
She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners
Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on
Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid
Cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'
Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?
I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing
Could leave his family, go back to the Carribean?
Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?
Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'
But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated
A man feels he has to conquer all
The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know
[Hook: Emily]
I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace
Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
When you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin'
What's the reason?
Oooh-whoa-ooh-whoa

[Verse 3: Nas]
I know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive
She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit
She called the cops cause she hated his mother
Now he away doin' numbers, now she gay with her lover
How many niggas gon' die this summer?
I pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder
There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer
It's odd, huh? Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife
He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night
Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz
In her pad while she slept
They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister
Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next

[Hook: Emily]
Emily harmonizes as Nas talks:
""Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what
Try to conquer all. So what? To all my niggas with they
Kids that love they kids, man. All the daddies out there
To all the niggas that died tryin'a figure out what's what
Tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know. Yeah, yeah
Ladies forgive us. Gotta forgive us. For we know not what
We do. Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and
Shit. Just man... man.""3Embed"

Switch lanes in monster whips, ambience
Specially dressed, guess who? -- Nas, it's obvious
Step to bars, we just order dark liquors
Clear liquors, y'all niggas are S-E-X
Yes we get respected, eclectic messages
Left our brains, straight into a female's estrogen
She feels electric, her breasts she's touchin' them
Wet 'tween the legs from this thug seduction
N-A-S, bend they ass over, spank it
Whisperin' she loves intelligent gangstas
Call fatties 'bubbles', call head 'skull'
Before I get either I need some Red Bull
She'll scream as I pushed in her freezing cold pool
When she piss she gon' bleed in the whole stool
That's how much I wanna bang and touch her pretty thing
Won't pluck no chicken wing, don't fuck with just anything
Gotta come up, run up and get touched up
Suicide, that's if you confront us

Don't talk, just hold your breath (Breath)
Been here a while, only one nigga left (Left)

Uh, from a boy to a king
Love to rock diamonds and fancy rings
I'm a thoroughbred, real heavy, mayne
I'm fuckin' something tonight that's on everything
Fellas who beat bodies with me
Kidnappers and stick-up kids, they all poli' with me
Pop bottles with me, button-up shirts and throwbacks
Old cats only roll when I'm in the city
And the dance floor it's disgustin'
Move your waistline to the basic percussion
I'm that, cool laid-back don who won't say nuttin'
And laugh when a nigga start frontin'

First you said you would spread for me in an instant
See me with the next chick, now you act different
Power of the stick shift, now I embarrass her
Play your position, you way outta character
Do the knowledge, graduated hood college with honors
Pay homage to Nas, Dickies and Converse
On the eyes shades in the nighttime regardless
The army's so thick you can't harm us

Sitting up drunk, shuffling thoughts
Got paper but I'm lost
Losing focus, what a nigga still hustling for?
My seed is straight, the family's settled
Idle time get the man in trouble
When wifey tourin', my life get borin'
Start to remember all types of torment
The devil's callin', but I don't answer
Mom passed from cancer, leaving behind
Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two nines
Next to me in the Phantom, who lying?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Dada, trying to stay away from creeps
With their bullshit, trying to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
Where Feds be laying, from a dreadful slaying
Body viewings, at the wake
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket
With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci
I'm above the standard
But dudes is more zealous than Branford
Thinking you're too rich, they want to gun ya
Kidnap ya, cause of they hunger, but you fucking with hunters
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit

Twitching shit, all up in your body language
Mean mugging your bitch, because she leans over
To look closer, told you: ""Y'all sloppy gangsters"", saying:
""Nas is this, and Nas is that""
Your eyes go front, your eyes go back
Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at
It's obvious you don't know how I react
Like, I don't know where the party's at
You're foaming at the mouth, losing breath
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed
Because the fact is, y'all don't really want it
Two to the head, four to the stomach
Call more security because, I come off
Anywhere you at, you scary cats
If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain
A thousand times harder, than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence, but see
The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude, that kick it to me
We posess, the recipes for death, because jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for Salmonella poisoning
I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food
And say: ""That's the way you kill a man
Avoid the shooting"", hey {*echo* x4}

You smile, in my face
Secretly I know, you want my place
You waiting on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe
Want to come cut my throat, you want to get rid of me
But before I let it happen, them guns going to start clapping
And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe
Before I let it happen them guns going to start clappin

Yeah, yeah, yeah
You was born in the eighties, pops drove a Mercedes
Did a bid, coming home to some grown ass kid
Crack baby turn to young thug, description might fit you
Look around it might hit you
No joke, I wanna pistol fight with you
Shit comes around faster than you think
Blood and white chalk makes pink, so what's that make you?
Become a creature of habitat, the average cat
Won't see where it's at, or where it's going
The hood waits for no one
I've been through it from Ewings to Buicks, to body viewings
Car chases to court cases, to fly vacations
From wanting it all, to being the object of your admiration
Imagination is what they lack
It stops niggas from getting stacks
Feeling trapped on the block with loose cracks
Wisdom is vital for the survival of the street's disciple

In the gutter, which was once ghetto prophecy is now ghetto scripture
Lookin back at it, blowjobs from pretty crack addicts
Older Gods wantin no static, told some lil' niggas they can have it
Coke baggin and toe-taggin
They took Will, let me describe him, a live one
I think that he was the true +God's Son+ - not Jesus, but fearless
His ear was up on them sounds too, he'd hear somethin
Not to his likin, and say 'Son they bitin you""
He never got to see my debut, wild-mannered
But wild with them hammers, niggas frontin couldn't stand it
Took him off the planet, left us in 9-2
With the philosophy of what arms do, a true street's disciple

Plug the mics up, I'm ready to rock, knocking
Reminiscing of measuring pots of Pyrex, cook in the kitchen
Captain Hook to these infants
It's like my folks is still on the benches
Surrounded by villains and henchmen, was a killer convention
1991, son, gold fronts on the facial, gun buck by the naval
Disciple could blaze you, we laced it with embalming fluid
Rhyming to music all this time
Fighting 'bout how Kane and Rakim would do it
Seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave
From the block, where the world was forever freezing
Hell if I ever let them shovel me, son, in this cell again
Fuck these devil policemen, plush leathers, I need them
Risking my freedom, burners in bubble coats
Fuck a sermon from the neighborhood pope
He's sexing ho's, old fart, he's busting ones when he stroke
Multi-colored Pelle Pelle's, young stretch mark bellies

Couldn't do it without you. Chapter 1

[Verse]
January 28, 1968
Born into this world, William Griffin The Great
Chapter 1, Wyandanch, Long Island
Scientific rhyming invented a new style when
He met with Eric Barrier from East Elmhurst
The melody they created was the first
Burst on the scene 1986, with clap to this
'87 dropped a classic disc
The facts is the tracklist was like full
The vocals, the beats, according to Marley Marl
Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge
That's why it's so relative
This biography was unauthorized
I spit it how it was given to author Nas
William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah
Cause Clarence 13X had New York on lock
Gods on every block, jams in every park
I remember hearing Kurtis Blow saying
""It can't get better than this""
'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits
From leather coats to shell toes to the Stan Smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks
First million-dollar deal ever in rap
18th Letter did that
From 4th & Broadway to Uni to MCA
We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre
Supreme, Rap and the 50 that don't rap
Fort Greene, Queens, Strong Island wolfpack
Paid In Full posse, hot they was on
And Ra had his firstborn
With the next line I'ma be easy
His wisdom's name is Fifi
EPMD put a record out, was dope
Tension spread, and I quote
""Smack me and I smack you back""
Sounded like the answer to the ""I Ain't No Joke"" track
For a second it ain't look good
Little tension buzzing from Wyandanch to Brentwood
Misunderstood, all forgot
At sixteen when I met Freddie Foxxx
Toting burners, the whole coast's most concern was
How has Rakim's flow made Christians convert with Islamic ways
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP
A sophisticated mean one
Before similar voices were King Sun
A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom
At sixteen, son was watching him, mesmerized
Respect, not jocking him, was so amazing, besides
He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
Walk with me now

Ooh-ooh, so stuck up, told me shut the fuck up
BLAOW! Ludacris in the how-oooh-ouse!
The needle hit the record, they was playin' this song
All the ladies hit the floor and it was uh-uh-on (ugh!)
Live forever like 'Fame,' let the Leroys dance
While I'm laid back, chillin' in my b-boy stance (c'mon!)
Could be a little pop lockin' if your girl's top droppin' (yeah)
But watch for cockblockin' on my coochie stock options (woo!)
But later for the ASSDAQ, throw 'em on the fast track
Make 'em swip-swap; Nasty N-A-S, pass that

18.0,Remember the Times,Street’s Disciple,2004,"Remember the Times Lyrics[Nas]
I think I can remember some...

[Verse 1]
Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
Nasty though, she used to try to eat my excrement
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her
Put hickeys on her stomach
Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch and screw
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume
That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude
Used to put my face in her crotch
Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer
While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha
While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker
[Hook]
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
And all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind
But none of them could touch you

[Verse 2]
Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes
Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction
Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection
Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log
Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind
Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when fucked us
Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher
Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa
The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong
Under the coat and
Put a show on just to show me she loved me
She would undress and wait in zero below weather
In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'
Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin
Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it
Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets
Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters
Long chin, some with funny odors
Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease
And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool
And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww
Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas
Principles are lined up, things prioritized
See mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer
Are we tempted

19.0,The Makings of a Perfect Bitch,Street’s Disciple,2004,"The Makings of a Perfect Bitch Lyrics[Hook]
I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with
And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch
Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch

[Verse 1]
A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife
I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper
Mad niggas in this one predicament
You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it
My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin'
Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing
So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man
A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand
And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her
I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker
I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League
Next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee
What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef
Say goodbye to the stress
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever
These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better
Four cycles of blood, child birth first
Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death
That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth
Put 'em together, that's a genius, a slut and a chef
Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh
Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess
If she survives she'll be sucking me next
Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck while she do
My taxes for the IRS
So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed
I'm her daddy, I'm her messiah, I'm god
Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart
Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death
I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Gimme Sade's mystique, she gotta know her way in the streets
Like Billie Holiday in Harlem
Body from Ki Toy Johnson and Kenya Moore in Apple Bottoms
Maya Angelou's brain and some groove from Terry McMillan
Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit
Helping me load clips
Some words from a pimp was, ""Nas, it just don't exist""
But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses
All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect
But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie
Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt

This ain't no sucka-for-love shit
This ain't no Huxtable-kisses-and-hug shit
First night we fuck, shit, and don't call the next day
This a thug's wedding day, in love
Will we make it? Let us pray
In the limo my niggas, my father, my brothers
Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted
Hard bottles, mob costumes this ain't no act though
Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more
Yes I'm absolutely sure
I know that she love me, I know that she faithful
We spoke on a prenumptial agreement
Cuz Will and Jada ain't need it
Spoke on eloping, but then I deaded the thought
Cuz she deserves cinderella's ball and the whole shit
But know this
You fuckin' wit' a slit your throat quick
Vehicular explosion, cigar smokin', dark minded, chart climbin
Well spokin say farewell to broke men or rich ones
Throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it hun
Headed to the chapel, my niggas laughin, and its baffling
Cuz just a year ago, it's weird though, I knew I'd get married
To who I knew not
Thought of snatchin Halle up from the dredlock
Pumpin Sade, my head nod
Finally I met the perfect bitch, pardon my French
Rephrase that, someone who make my heart stop
Couldn't wait to blaze that
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey, HIV spreadin'
Everybody bump the same bunnies
The game, will put niggas in they grave
Right before they part ways, with the street
I want a son to greet, every mornin'
Daughters and more sons tickle my feet
Wife smilin, tellin me it's time to eat
I'm getting married
[Hook: Nas] (3X)
Say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigalo
It was difficult for me to find the chick I want

[Verse 2: Nas]
It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on and ride
Even Martin Luther King had a fling on the side
That's what the negative one's say
Knew my wedding would be one day, but quickly its this day
I know the hoes gonna miss me
Lookin' at ol' photos, sayin' damn he used to twist me
Start chokin' up since I woke up
Bachelor party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
Father saw me in a daze, nudged me wit' his left arm
Told me how him and moms went to city hall, dressed norm
Said she would love me in my Ozwald Boateng
Customized in London by guys who suitup kings
Girl, you get the rings young, you behave
Maxwell he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang
Baltimore, North Cacky, Mississippi
Family packed in, My nigga L is crazy tipsy
Spilled Pepsi on the cuflings, ginger ale got it out
Walked in the church, chest all big to thug it out
My girl walked in, glistenin', different stones
'Bout to go from my fiance' to Mrs. Jones
That's a union that nobody could touch
I gotta be cool, wit ur crazy aunts and uncles
Cuz I love you much, cuz you put up wit' my shit
Court cases, baby mamas
I make a honest woman outta you yet
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter standin
Heart poundin out my chest like a canon
I'm happy, One of my groomsmen, under the music, says don't do it
But they just jokes, some crew shit, they playin', I'm gleeful
I'm stayin I'm sayin vowels all true
Will you take music as your wedded wife? I DO
Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin to
I'm getting married

Uh, yeah the booty is the bass
The highs, the beauty in ya eyes
First glance I became alive
She went through a lot of dangerous guys, surprise
Now she would decide on Nas
Cause I ain't choose her, she chose me
In the party, it was a early day in March
When I first had ya legs arched
In the park, wasn't even dark
We was in the zone, we ain't care who watch
Baby was the wine though the trees was sparked
She said till you get enough, please don't stop
So I played wit it, got the moist spot hot
If I ain't hittin' the bottom, I'm getting some top
My hair cut look air brushed
Whatever I wear is straight plush from the ears to chucks
As we sashayed across the dance floor
Just, me and you no one else but us two

No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl lookin' as good as you)

In the early eighties, shorty had me off the wall
A super freak as my thoughts revolved

Both they fathers a tell me to play, sip rosé
On our honeymoon everyday
We dance to the same tune every day
Beauty and the goon they would say
You promise, savage beast
You a sexy freak
Your moist lips negates the ecstacy
Number one in my book, no discrepancy
When you walk on the earth, you be reppin' me
I'm obsessed with thee, cherish every breath you breathe
No matter what's going on around us

You see I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City
Where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir
All the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster
He'll be the greatest man alive (Let's go!)

Chuck Berry of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging the gap, from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo

Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's

All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, ""Mr. Jones please come get your child
Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild""

And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright

Yeah, Brooks Brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth as Hall & Oates
Briefcase, silk ties, slick as them older folks
Silver fo'-fo', cocked? No
My chauffeur driver just left some of my colleagues smoking that Cali
Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window
Kinda' see my father's features creeping in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her
And I'm late to a date with my wife, I realize
I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
And I'm walking through it, chaos is all around me
But God got me, no fear, through the fire, try and stop me

And all this drama's got me feeling uptight

Holding our baby in her baby in her arms
So hold on, your daddy's in sight

For the first time, praise God, baby mom's crying
Planned to be a strong black family
But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashing

Nothing but the worst type, worst fight
When we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib raging
In my new car bought from entertainment
Champagne and gaining clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club hugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, ""never disrespect me""
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the Land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezing the pen, released again, chart toppers
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world
Checking out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazing, playing, life is so crazy
I'm grown up and thankful for lessons God gave me

Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets, niggas
Little kids scared cops, with red dots
Philosophical gangsta, with violent priors
Going back like black and white TVs with pliers
Leaning on broke down cars with flat tires
Flash iron on anybody trying on the blocks I'm supplying on
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em, and the P now got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged with wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Moss
Listening to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple
When I'm writing, semi-automatic, no hyphen
It's frightening
[Hook x4]
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move with

[Verse 2]
I take summers off 'cause I love winter beef
Started '87, with the shotty in the sheep
Three-quarter length, beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Woolrich, Carhart, gun powder stains
Smelling like trees, sensimille on the brain
Scheming on your girls, bamboos on your chain
Got ill up on the train
Twisting off a cap of a English in my vein
Might've pushed you on the tracks
Deaf crack fiends who can't speak, scream noises
Cause she bought a jum of soap from one of my boys
It's just another day in the hood
And I'm with some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them pile, then we robbin 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino going

1.0,Money Over Bullshit,Hip Hop Is Dead,2006,"Money Over Bullshit Lyrics[Verse 1]
My niggas got scarred grills, skully hats and gats be fullies
Brrrat! Cars peel, the East Coast cartel
Rats get their tails snapped and trapped
The snitches in the streets and the snitches who rap
Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of you
Coroner choruses sung from The Bridge to Astoria
Dreams of falling in the elevator, passing floors
Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall
I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad-luck prayers
Picture your tarot cards and bodyguards getting sprayed up
Sabotaging my makeup, my watches get laced up
Even if they indicted Jacob
Forensics, paramedics, carry cowards off
Defibrillators shock to your chest, try to cough
They die and hit Hell from an iron
I'm fly in YSL, I'm paid from this shit
Got bitches high as hell, and they fucking like AIDS don't exist
They get sent to your hotel, I'm made in this shit
Put a barrel in a capo mouth 'til his scalp come out
You a kid, you don't live what you rap about
King poetic, too many haters to count
Too much paper to count (QB, bitch!)
[Chorus]
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn (Mourn)
Money over bullshit,pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn (My own strength, nigga! That's what I'm afraid of!)
Money over bullshit, pistols over brawn (Hahaha)
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength

[Verse 2]
Got seven candles lit, black wallpaper, black carpet
Thinking about which nigga to target
You kill a nigga today, he lives forever
So I plotted out smarter, there'll be no martyrs
Black TEC on the table, Mag' four-four
Black negligée on my bitch, she's at the door
Black fish eggs, nigga, that's the caviar
You niggas fish-made, y'all niggas is fifth grade, niggas
It's fifty ways to dissect the General
If I give ya the top five, you will not survive
Rule 1: Cocksucker, keep my name from your tongue
Rule 2: Thought you knew—don't fuck with God's Son
Rule 3: See, matter fact, I just wait
If y'all reach top five, then I'ma eat y'all alive
Each one of ya guys that claim hip-hop is still alive
Like y'all ain't in agreement with Nas
I said it's dead motherfucker, it's dead, bitch…
[Chorus]
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn (It's dead, bitch!)
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength

[Verse 3]
From crack pushers to Lac' pushers and ambushers
And morticians to fortresses, case-dismisses
Laced in riches, cake ridiculous
From nickel and dimin' to trickin' them diamonds
Vegas, places in Switzerland
From 9 blastin' to I don't have to blast mine
They blast mine, black 9, you flatline, my cash climb
Buy rare art, antique pieces, Mona Lisa's, own no leases
Five-star restaurant eaters; don't forget who your peeps is
'Sposed to dine with you, sip that good wine with you
Only if they grind with you or slang for ya
Seen niggas live, laugh, party and die in that very same corner
Pretty girls glance at us, status unconceivable
Private planes landed out in Teterboro, weed I twirl
Once even gave me a phobia, that I be in a spot trapped like Madame Zenobia's with this kid eyein' my Rollie up
[Chorus]
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah y'all... New York City...
Tryna to see where I'ma go tonight...
The most famous town in the whole fuckin' world...
The other night, nigga was at Lotus...
I hit P and them
I was Dom P'ed up in there, you know...
But I found this new spot we went to the other night, yo
Check it out, check it out how it went

[Verse 1]
It was just cool like, smooth night with my jewels bright
Goons left, goons right, coupe with blue lights
Bad girls in black pearls, gave us cat calls
Took 'em back to the crib to break they ass off
In the loft, mixing hash and dro
Honey spreaded that asshole like a wide mouth bass
Sippin' wine out the glass, Teddy Pendergrass blast
When the phone ring, the house lights flash
Turned down the sound, let's get down to business
Shit about to go down with some foul niggas
What the voice said, ""What up, pop? Who want it?""
I put the guap up, get the boy popped
He say ""Son, stop, it's dudes you feedin'
Who feedin' other dudes, but they really not eatin'""
Dog, why you callin' me? This our food
You handle the mouths that it trickles down to
Niggas want beef, I want some of that cow too
But I'm in my princely robe, simply rich
Don't bother me with silly shit, call Rico
He said ""It IS Rico, of all people
Gave his moms furs, called up the mayor
To get his crime pardoned, his son's godfather""
Said the nigga shot up my cars
Last night he laid for me to come out my doors?
[Chorus]
Niggas always on that bullshit
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
Niggas always on that bullshit
Now your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit
Niggas always on that bullshit
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
Niggas always on that bullshit
Now your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit
You can't kill me

[Verse 2]
High, fly, send a fella loaf or glass
Fold up cash, you ain't heard the soldier's half
You speakin' hogwash, silly shit, Balderdash
I got the live sparked, Phillies lit, smoker's jacket on
The son of a Cap-ricorn, my dad's a don
What you think that he spawned? A slacker? Nah
Packed the 9's, yo this nigga's asinine
Smack your mom, relaxed and calm, then mack your mom
In a casket, you'll get your fashion on
You'll be in a suit and tie, you'll die
You'll make maggots turn to flies, fuckin' with Nas
Remember anyone can get it at anytime
Lames'll swear by your name, when they lie
Get hit with the lone star, ripped where your bones are
So tell me how yo' ass gon' run, from a C-Z-P-0-1?
In the midst of real steel movers, you a loser
Merk you wit your own shooters
All you want is a name, pissed and insane
My security system, my playspot a fireplace, listen
Then it goin' off, start spittin'
Niggas try to bring it where I live in
Trustin' you, knew where all of the cribs at
So we waited with the Sigs, blat, blat, blat!
[Chorus]
Niggas always on that bullshit
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
Niggas always on that bullshit
Now your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit
Niggas always on that bullshit
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip

3.0,Carry On Tradition,Hip Hop Is Dead,2006,"Carry On Tradition Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, niggas want to talk about this rap shit
Niggas want to talk about this money
About these cars, these homes, these labels
Clothes, sneakers, big money shit
Now everybody trying to get rich
Now get rich niggas, fuck it

[Verse 1]
Some rap pioneers be them crackheads
When they speak, you see missin' teeth
Silver chain with a silver piece
Niggas your grandfather's age, they pants still hangin' down they legs, talkin' about they ain't paid
And they hate you, ‘cause they say you ain't pay dues
And [Sylvia Robinson was stealin' and robbin' them]
I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve
Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died
Wasn't Sylvia's fault or because MC's skills are lost
It's because we can't see ourselves as the boss
Deep-rooted through slavery, self-hatred
The Jewish stick together, friends in high places
We on some low level shit, we don't want niggas to ever win
See, everybody got a label
Everybody's a rapper, but few flow fatal
It's fucked up, it all started from two turntables
[Chorus]
When they crown you and you rise up to your position
Carry on tradition
When they knight you, then you go to fight
Go to war, don't petition, carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition
Carry On Tradition
When you rep what we rep, then carry on tradition

[Verse 2]
Now some of these new rappers got their caps flipped backwards
With their fingers intertwined in some gang-sign madness
I got an exam, let's see if y'all pass it
Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest
Some of you new rappers, I don't understand your code
You have your man shoot you, like in that Sopranos episode
Do anything to get in the game, mixtapes
You spit hate against bosses; hungry fucks are moralless
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate vocalists
Niggas, I could've wrote your shit
I had off-time, was bored with this
I could've made my double-LP
Just by samplin' different parts of Nautilus
Still came five on the charts with zero audience
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit
Y'all got awards for your bricks – it got good to ya
You started tellin' them bigger dogs to call it quits?! WHAT?
[Chorus]
When they crown you and you rise up to your position
Carry on tradition
When they knight you, then you go to fight
Go to war, don't petition, carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition
Carry On Tradition
When you rep what we rep, then carry on tradition

[Verse 3]
Now niggas got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer
Engineers got his earplugs and still hear us
The live-in-the-park sound versus the studio state of art sound. We on the charts now
From British Walkers and Argyles
Look at us rap stars now, with our black cars now
Fortune 500 listed, brunches, Cipriani's
Sippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me
Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up
Because I'm what? Every dime lust
We used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up
If I want that or the whole world to peep it
Now carry on tradition
Fuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'
Peace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em, I promise I carry on tradition

[Chorus]
When they crown you and you rise up to your position
Carry on tradition
When they knight you, then you go to fight
Go to war, don't petition, carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition
Carry On Tradition
When you rep what we rep, then carry on tradition3Embed"

Hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
(Had to flip this track again, y'all!)
Hip, hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
Hip, hip hop (Ugh!)
Hip, hip hop is dead (NYC! Dirty South!)
Hip, hip hop (West Coast!)
Hip hop (Midwest!)
Hip hop (Let's go!)
[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, niggas smoke, laugh, party and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Quick fast, trigger fingers on the llama
Revenge in their eyes, Hennessy and the ganja
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya, ""Nas helped grow us up""
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million and billin', I helped blow 'em up
Gave my man my right, I could have went left
So like my girl Foxy, the kid went deaf
So people, who's your top 10? Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?
[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ

I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missing the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why's that?
‘Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crack
‘Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together, all together now
[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake

Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip-hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka
RIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From ""Beat Street"" to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm looking over my shoulder
It's about 80 people from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut23Embed"

Look here see, Pretty Mike shanked Two-Face Al over some gal
Found the body dead in the isles
Death by strangulation, microphone cord, a dirty broad
Guess they'll never play it again Sam
Damn that was my jam, now she's on the lam
She made it out with 200 grand, what a scam
While these two compete on who's the star of the show
Golden legs there makes off with the dough
I read the paper there with Joe the Butcher
""He said one glance is all it took ya, she's a real looker
They say her old mans a bootlegger
Transporting in any weather and at this rate we'll never get her""
Fellas, think it's time to call it a night
All this talk of this mystery dame's getting me tight
Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right
Hate to spoil the party, ""What are you guys havin', the same?
Waiter another round for the gang.""
It's strange how I always felt outta place
Joe the Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face
So I said ""See you later.""
'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers
He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators
An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper
So I pulled the revolver on my waist up
Between the patrol car and the gray truck
Behind the street lamp was a silhouette
White gloves and a real long cigarette
What do you know all this time she's got me in her scope
She spoke, says, ""The devil got you guys by the throat
Your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence
That's the reason why Eric B. is not president.""
[Break]
Well what do ya say
Ya see?
Ya see?
Ya see?

[Verse 2]
Look here see, I know you got soul you're trying to hide it
How did you kill a man out in Cypress
One Eyed Charlie, he only hangs with the criminal minded
Says you guys did it doggy style is he lyin'
She says, ""Walk this way, I'll tell you a children's story.""
We hit the bodega got her a few 40's
We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide
Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty
Drinks like a fish, now she's past tipsy
The truth came out as we got to her suave house
Chopped and screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch
I said, ""It's gettin late, come on, give it to me straight
Who's ya sponsor lady?"" She says, ""Bill Gates.""
What are ya born '77 or '78?
She says, ""Nah it goes way to an earlier date
Slave times,"" claims the slaves said rhymes
But she fell in love with some fella named Clive
Who? ""Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave
The Bronx."", now she shows me the cash
I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt
She said Clive Campbell, he's Kool Herc

Ah-ha!
Ah-ha!

Listen up sweetheart now we gettin somewhere
As she's talking, she starts vanishing in thin air
But before she dropped the money bag on the floor and died
She said if you really love me I'll come back alive7Embed"

Esco, whattup? (Whattup, homie?)
I mean, it's what you expected, ain't it? (Hahaha)
Let's go... uhh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Uh, yeah, that's perfect (yeah, right, right)
Uhh, uh, you gotta take ya time, make a nigga wait on this muh'fucka (hahaha!)
Make niggas mad and shit like
Niggas usually just start rappin' after four bars, nigga, go in!
Just start dancin' in this muh'fucka
Yeah, (yeah) we just come outta nowhere
[Chorus: Jay-Z (Nas)]
I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, like, ""Fuck it then""
[Verse 1: Jay-Z (Nas)]
Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then (what?)
Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend
We had covenant, who would've thought the love would end?
Like Ice Cold's album (uhh), all good things
Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang
Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign, could bring
Should blame, the game, and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?
And forever be in debt, and that's never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out the worst in every person, even the good and sane
Although we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and Miss Thing
Jealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings
It all to a head like a coin, cha-ching
The root of evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point
This puts the ring in jeopardy – indefinitely
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Nas]
I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then""
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them (nah)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then""

[Verse 2: Nas (Jay-Z)]
I'm back in the hood, they like, ""Hey Nas"" (uh)
Blowin' on purp, reflectin' on they lives (uh)
Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s
Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies
Gray 5s, hatah's wishin' our reign dies
Pitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, ""Why""? (uhh)
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building
I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself, through the hoops of fire
Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good, that form street politics?
Makes a sweet honest kid, turn illegal for commerce (uhh)
To get his feet out of them Converse – that's my word
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Nas]
I feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, ah, ""Fuck it then""
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them

Yeah! Now what? Haha!
Get in the car now, let's go! Yeah let's go

This is so stupid, what are you doing?
Why are we even out here?
Why are we out here? What's going on?
This is retarded, yo, we gotta…
This is crazy. Never again
You'd throw everything away, for what?
[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, my man Kool G Rap told me, ""Son, do not look back""
Chill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax
When people act, school em' with facts, tell 'em
At this point in my life I'm all about chillin'
Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies
And twist, homie's hermano just died, I gotta let it ride
That's what I got the public thinkin', my nigga
Just ‘cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit, my nigga
I know who died before the body dropped
I know the guns that were used
How much money the shooter got
‘Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all
The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time
Is all we talk when we talk in New York, y'all
Who to call and who to stay away from
Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe, son
Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up
What cars and what trucks they drive in
What towns they spend the most time in when they grindin'
I found out most of them are cowards
They hidin' behind reputations that's sour; I'm not going back

[Chorus: Kelis and Nas]
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't come back again
I'm not going back!
Streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't come back again
I'm not going back!

First thing that happen when you make a little paper
You think the Marriott is livin' in a skyscraper
Till you come across some even more flyer paper
Realize that five-star tellies are even greater
Terry-cloth robes, elegance, movie shit
Heated-up marble floors with jacuzzis in it
First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes
All those things, you still ain't really doing shit, kid
‘Cause in reality, I'll earn my salary
The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me
It kinda make me wanna hate bling
It's a race thing how they sell blacks the bootleg shit
In fact, real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings
Whores charge niggas with raping
‘Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars
Watch us make bets on race tracks, smokin' cigars
So they counter the laws to take what's ours
'Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge
So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars
Instead of going back, I'm buying the projects
But I'm not going back
The hood's in me forever y'all, but I'm not going back

[Chorus: Kelis and Nas]
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't come back again
I'm not going back!

Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't come back again
I'm not going back!
[Break: Nas]
And of course y'all know what I'm not going back to
Those no friends of mine… (And I'm not going back to)
Ten carat gold, no shine… (And I'm never going back to)
Sony, if they don't have dough to resign…
(Not going back to)
Y'all know that I'm not going back to
Those liars who would… (Not going back to)
Not help you if they could… (Not going back to)
Coke on the stove in the hood…
Y'all should know that I'm not going back
The hood's in me forever y'all, but I'm not going back

[Chorus: Kelis and Nas]
The streets keep tryin' to say (Ugh)
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way (That's right)
I won't come back again
I'm not going back!

Come back around this way (Don't try to pull me down man)

[Intro: Kanye West]
Some people really are
Yeah, uh, uh
And as the sun sets
And the night falls
And them ho's call

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
He pulled up at 6:30 in a 745
As he waving ""Shorty, hi"", you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl caught feelings, she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be going through problems, you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep? What do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce
She gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out doing the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out
[Chorus: Kanye West, Nas & Chrisette Michele]
Some people really (Still dreamin')
Some people really (Make you scream out)
Some people really are (Still dreamin')
Still dreamin' (Wha-wha-wha-wha-One-two one two)
Some dreams stay dreams, some dreams come true
They are still dreamin'(Wha-wha-wha-wha-One-two one two)
Some dreams stay dreams, some dreams come true
Some people really (Yeah)
Some people really (y-y-yeah)
Some people really are (Ugh)
[Verse 2: Nas]
How you a man waiting for the next man to get rich?
Your plan is to stick out your hand real quick
So if he feed your family and he serve you shit
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch
Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all your life
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright
When you was getting cash but wasn't too bright
Now your luck down, you feel like bustin' them shells
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggas to show you, how to come up with green
I schemed since I'm 14, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, saying you was seen
With little niggas with a chain, you was doing your thing
How high was I? You the thousandth guy
That came around thinking we can see eye to eye
We on a different echelon
Could've got bread together, now you get skedded on
[Refrain: Sample of Kanye West and Nas]

[Verse 3: Nas]
She had several cars, she had credit cards
A castle, large master bathroom, getting a pedicure
Bellinis by the glassful, said she been meaning to ask who
Who in need of cash who, who could blast tools
And I'm eating cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual
‘Cause I knew her since high school
Grew up with my dudes, like one of my crew
She worked for Fox News
One of her mans that she lent her drop to
Won't come back with it, so she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snorting and her eyes had bags in it
She was recording, had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged with bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards

I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination to change the situation

[Verse 1: Nas (Mark B. Mayfield)]
Yeah, Feds feast on street dons, look at their teeth showin'
Salivating at the mouth, South to East Orange
Keep pourin' that liquor, but nigga don't sleep on it
You'll be giving up your Jesus piece to your peeps to pawn it
For legal fees in the penal dorm
Screamin' on the horn with 'bout 30 years on your conscience
I'm watchin' brothers disappear, it's appallin'
Some dudes had just only a year of ballin'
Counter-intelligence found a strange evidence
(When the block is hot)
Still we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates
Position we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in
Waves spinnin' like Mike Bivens from New Edition agin'
(I gotta... when the block is hot)
I got families I'm feedin', 'cause my mans is bleedin'
Every five seconds look in all directions
I come through prepared, I give 'em a call
""I'm close, bring them guns downstairs""

Uh, uh, it's beef week, Monday, murder
Two niggas dead, Tuesday
Wednesday and Thursday is hearse-day
Friday, somebody-gotta-die day
Saturday, put the gat away
Chillin' with your chick and a bag of haze
Wonderin' how it's all gon' end and what type of way
'Cause Sunday back to gunplay
Most shit start over nothin'
And get finished quick ‘cause the art of repercussion
Yeah, I seen it, a G going out indecent (when the block is hot)
Takin' a plea agreement, thinkin' he secret
Escape the crime scene, now you live straight like 9:15
Then one-time intervene (I gotta hold...)
My man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die
But the SIG Sauer on me now I'm scared to die
You thinkin' the one I send to clap you be a shorty
But he old school, holdin' a .38, he in his 40s

I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot (yeah, word to mother)
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation (yeah)

[Verse 3: Nas (Mark B. Mayfield)]
(I gotta...) Anytime brothers can't get jobs, then they rob
A man rather die than live on his knees and starve
Cops steady askin' your man what happened
First he tell, then he stop, like he not really rattin'
Guess he not really in that casket from a sawed-off
(When the block is hot)
Listen, peep game from the brain of an all-star
The rain hurt niggas' bones who been shot
Metal pins in their leg, they walk with a limp-hop
The streets lie (when the block is hot), so you better be cautious
Your man'll fry you plus everybody talkin'
A vet, a General, don't step where I walked in
Make your own path, be a legend in your skin
(Hold down the block, when the block is hot)
Make your own cash, don't stress what I'm flossin'
Don't expect more when you put in less work than all them
Queensbridge projects has taught him
And that's for life, you heard me right, I got the block

When the block is hot, when the block is hot

I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot

Yo, I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Haley
Got blazed before they told stories
I'ma get blazed before I tell y'all stories
I saw on TV today, this man lost his son, his son died
So he had him cremated
Took his ashes and then made it to a diamond ring
Now he watches his son shine everyday
I just thought about that
While I sit here ashing in this ashtray, yeah
[Verse 1]
The making of a mad band, intricate stories of DeVante Swing
Ava Gardner, the crashin' of James Dean
Bobby Brown influenced by Rick James and it goes
Prince wanted Alexander O'Neal to be Morris Day or Jerome
But Alex was putting coke in his nose, nigga whylin'
Could be a myth, but I swear that the source was close
Phyllis Hyman killed herself, it was crazy
Mommy was bad they say
Donny Hathaway free-fall from a balcony, he swayze

[Hook]
As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me
Did I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
And will the money and fame outlast me?
The blunts ash falls down in the ashtray
Well, I see my whole life fly past me
I'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
Did I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me

[Verse 2]
Sam trusted Womack with his main lady
He tossing in the grave like, ""This is how you repay me?!""
A change gon' come, wish you didn't trust me so much
Marvin said ""No mountain's high enough,"" fly stuff
David Ruffin was punchin' Tammi Terrell
Gave her concussions
While the Funk Brothers was laying down the percussion
When Flo from the Surpremes died, Diana Ross cried
Many people said that she was laughin' inside
[Hook]
As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me
Did I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
And will the money and fame outlast me?
The blunts ash falls down in the ashtray
Well, I see my whole life fly past me
I'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
Did I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me

[Verse 3]
John F. Kennedy's enemies dealt with treachery
It interests me. Judy Campbell in Gucci sandals
She's what a temptress be
The death of Ennis Cosby, what a mystery!
Or the Chicagoan Harold Washington
Someone is sabotaging 'em
Watch out for the traps
Larry Troutman killed his brother Roger Troutman
Then he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp
And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats
This is what came from their pain
From their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange

[Hook]
As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me
Did I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
And will the money and fame outlast me?

Well, I see my whole life fly past me
I'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
Did I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me

I could smell old Bogey cigars
Lauren Bacall perfumes, smelling just as sweet
Me and my wife K, flying in a drop-top
Like Ruby and Ossie Davis, baby – know what I mean?
Yo, man, I get smoked out, and start thinking 'bout
Hattie McDaniel got a Oscar
For playing Mammy in ""Gone with the Wind""
And she didn't get allowed
Wasn't even allowed to go to the premier
Believe that? Couldn't go to premier to her joint

Yeah, check check, testing
It's clear out there, yeah
It's like I'm hang glidin' over the hood, ha
Never worry (ohhh, no, no, no)

[Verse 1]
Check, let there be light
No gang bangin' in New York tonight
Just murals of Biggie Smalls, bigger than life
Turn up the kid mic ‘cause ya'll ain't listenin' right
What's all this talk that Nas got bought?
I'd rather outline my body in white chalk
Ain't nobody been where I been, they at a stand still
This is all overseen by my man Will
[Hook: Tre Williams]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And I know my business, so my sins great
And I thank the hood for all the love they gave
And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate
Oh, let there be light!

[Verse 2]
This ain't to glorify, just painting a street picture
There's no guidance or Bibles, just blunts and swishers
Gillettes cut 'caine in kitchen
Now every rapper wanna claim he hang with Kenneth ""Supreme"" McGriff, and
It's like the same difference except when niggas get arraigned
They don't want the same sentence, niggas get to snitchin
If I could reverse demises and turn falls to rises
And bring back the niggas who was livest
Old hustlers, reminiscing on better days
They home, doing nothing, might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers, one foot in the grave
They used to love us
Till we found our own way through the maze
New York, set trippin' and flaggin'
Got the West Coast laughin'
Now Esco's askin', ""What happened?""
My homegirl from upper Manhattan; she remembers the quarters that's Latin, a lot of rat-a-tat-tattin'
[Hook: Tre Williams]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And I know my business, so my sins great
And I thank the hood for all the love they gave
And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate
Oh, let there be light!

[Verse 3]
The son of the audio cassette era, TEC wearer
Bullets and baguettes, Benz Bose Speaker Terror
Deman I get mine till I'm dead, so I can drive somethin' red
Like that horse standing on it's hind legs
Since Arnold and Willis in they bunk beds
I wanted bread like Wonder
Not Ned the Wino like the parents of Lionel
Nas is the Ghetto American Idol
No matter what you do you're never getting my title
I can't sound smart, ‘cause y'all will run away
They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about Ye
Like there's no other way for a ex-hustler
Cake getter, the ex-wig splitter to touch you, I beg to differ
When you're four years into the game
We can have a conversation
Eight years in the game, I invite you on vacation
Ten years in the game, after I've enjoyed my fame
Only then I let you pick my brain, niggas

[And I] Right about now [And I] (They don't really know)
[And I] (They don't really see)
I don't even deal with all that garbage
(No, no, no) We getting real right, you know?

Focus on good things, man, good times, heh-heh, alright

Uh, light somethin', stop frontin'

How much money's enough? Think maybe like a trillion figures
Pray my daughter don't wild like the Hilton sisters
That'd kill me yo, filthy rich
My daughter pass it onto the next generation
Throwing carnations at my tombstone
In my new home, meet Mom's in my Yves Saint Laurent suit on
Then we do a dance
Like my man Luther jam, but my verse came first
I stole change out her purse, now I wanna dig her up
Outta the earth, too morbid, lean forward
Toward a new paragraph, Blue carrots, D-class
Strictly that kush in the weed bags
Tryna' figure out what Barry Gordie had put in production
Studio's smokey now, hard like David Ruffin
Hit a spliff through a seance, and uh, play on, playa
[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Gotta' get your papes on, play on, playa
Before it's all gone, sip Don, tip waiters
Do y'all thing, ménage, swing, baby
Spend dubs on your bruhs, gotta live crazy
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Get your papes on, play on, playa
Get your papes on, play on, playa

[Verse 2: Nas]
Ruby red grapefruit juice with Grey Goose
Rubies in the Jesus piece, pimped out like Snoopy
But a East Coast thing, my girl's stocking
Tied up in a knot top of my bean head
Billion dollar dream head, went from triple beams to digitals
Servin' fiends to minimal, sixty G's
No criminal, no mo', just mo' dough
Mimosas pouring, Oprah's earrings
On fingers while your girl performs cunnilingus
‘Cause this big money aroma lingers
Barber cleans his blade, then they give me a fade
Hot towel on the face, hot models who vomit
After they eat so they can stay lightweight
Swallowin' my protein like an Ovaltine shake
Come through like Mo Green from Godfather, so clean
Where I step I 'Clorox it', keep twenty G's
On both sides of the thighs, that's four pockets
Eighty thou to browse for the nicest price
But we ain't into buyin' conflict ice
That's the shit they stole from the Congo, and other black soil
True mack fo' you, nappy hair just spinning
Honey gave me a massage with a happy ending
Finest females, I just came on and sprayed her
Got to get your papes on, play on, playa

[Verse 3: Snoop]
It's kinda hard for a playa like you
But let me show you how a nigga like me get revenue
What you never do is punk out, what you better do
Never let the game get ahead of you, get a better view
Better yet, a better crew, praise God, I'm a marry you
Get ya holy, carry you, bury you, slowly
Roll me another blunt, stuff it
Lick it, puff it, tuck it, fuck it
That man, that game, that thing it busts
In D-O-Double-G we trust
Yup, yup, young loc with the two steps
He creepin' with two TEC's, they sleepin' with two chicks
Right before we blast, all you heard was two clicks (Bloaw!)
End of existence, for instance
Rewind, replay it, re-chop it, remix it, re-twist it
Goddamn, D-O-Double-G, cuz, we missed it
Travel slow, I'm an Indian, but not a Navajo
I smoke the big leaf, end all the big beefs
My hair in two braids, I'm the big chief
La-da-da, be-da-ba-da…

[Verse 1: Nas]
There comes a day in your life when you wanna kick back
Straw hat on the porch when you old perhaps
Wanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one
Brag, to your grandkids on how life is golden
So I'mma light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, 8 by 10's
Of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame
Colliding with big names that could've made your career stop
All that, and your man is still here and I'm still hot
Wow, I need a moment y'all
See I almost felt a tear drop
[Bridge: Nas]
When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
Ohh, I'm that history I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you)

[Verse 2: Nas]
Can't forget about the old school, Bam, Caz, Melle Mel, Flash
Rocksteady spinnin on they back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince
Fat Boys broke up, rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it messed you up
When Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry hit to win the game in the finals kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first made love
[Bridge: Nas]
When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time

This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Unforgettable, unsubmittable, I go by N now
Just one syllable, it's the end cause the game's tired
It's the same vibe, Good Times had right after James died
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines
And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm a dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past enough of it, aight then
But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25
[Bridge: Nas]
When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time

So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face
The one kid that would've been Aftermath that got away
But we still get together, like, every several years
To sprinkle a little bit of Heaven for your ears
Relax, sippin' Cliquot in Rio, stupid fuckers
Low-key, no G's, but it's still Gucci luggage
I love Cape Cod, and watching fly bitches with gray eyes
Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by
I like to celebrate, why? ‘Cause I can vision
Collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate
So every breath I take is all about the rules
It's hard for you to breathe, like you at high altitude
So crack the Patron, it's on heathens

I'm in the record shop with choices to make
Illmatic on the top shelf, The Chronic on the left, homie
Wanna cop both but only got a 20 on me
So fuck it, I stole both, spent the 20 on a dub sack
Ripped the package off Illmatic and bumped that
For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhymed
I was the only Compton nigga with a ""New York State of Mind""
Inside the dope house, bottlin' up sherm
Bangin' The Firm, Dre was king then so I waited my turn
Fast forward, now I'm making 'em burn
Ended my peers' careers
Hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned
So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga
I stopped beefin' with niggas, ‘cause I'm ""Ether"" to niggas
Comb the earth 'til there's no one left
If I ruled the world I summons all you weak rap niggas to death

Fuck ass niggas, get bucked ass niggas
Pluck ashes of Cuban cigars, you foolin' with Nas
That's my name and I came with Rugers this time
And if I'm sane that Soul Plane movie's the bomb

Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm busting
See that's malarky you yappin'

Symbolize the rap life, it was slick and smooth
I understood I had to come from the hood
Doing the Pee Wee Herman, the Smurf
Before them phones chirped
The block's drugs flowing, didn't have your own work
You had to have somebody else's, a small chrome on your pelvis
Starter jacket, Blue Georgetown or Green Celtic
Your girl's too expensive, she want shellfish
Red Lobster was popping, standing on that line forever
I wish somebody would step on my Bally leathers
Now it's whatever
Hip Hop's forever
Kept my radio on 98 or BLS
Had a pre-pubescent lyric gift, but niggas never hear me spit
My little brother tried to warn them, I was a tornado coming
He knew from inside like the eye of a storm, and told my pops about it
He gave us tickets to that Wild Style flick
Double Trouble retarded, we was the proudest
I never had a summer job
Sweeping leaves, socks to my knees
Home-made shorts, cut off Lee's
I ain't work a day in my life
Wiping away eraser off the paper, man
I'm just trying to say it right
Big radio, tape's slowing down
Lower the lights go, battery dead
I got to freeze them 'till they're ice cold
In the freezer later, I'm staring at the speaker
Sunk in them 808s deeper, cleaning my sneakers
With the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water
I let the shoestrings soak in water

17.0,Shine On,Hip Hop Is Dead,2006,"Shine On Lyrics[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Hook:]
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
They wanna shine on 'em
Shine on 'em
Shine on 'em
[Verse 1:]
Yea, they dug me out the soil and the mines of the motherland
Now I'm displaced, one hand to another hand
Illegal smugglin', people strugglin'
Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again
Yea, guess that's how we got here, slave trade and the diamond trade
Every childs afraid when his mother and father get sprayed
Forced in the army, young killer brigade
Get's a new name, then he gets his nose glued
Till his mind can't take what he's going through
Lookin' in the dirt for that ice so blue
Then the royal family the ice go to
And this thing has to change, feelin' half ashamed
As I rap with my platinum chain
When you shop for me you think about the misery?
The same way we made apartheid history
We can do the same way to the conflict ice
But everybody wanna shine right?

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
My VVS glimmers on my chest, 200 thou encrusted watch on my wrist
I wonder how how people starve to death, when God blessed the land that lacks the harvest
The stones are quality, but their homes are poverty
And the whole world ignores the robbery
Bought my girl pretty rocks, but she mad at me
Tear drop shape, ugh, perfect clarity
It shocks so many are killed annually
Cause of greed, lust, and pure vanity
Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it
Every holiday season, jewelry stores crowded
Kids snatched from they homes, mutilated alive
Husbands separated from wives
Keep a Jesus Piece to be fly
But there was a time back in the day when they called that shine

[Verse]
Ayo, Queens get the money, niggas still screaming, paper-chasing
Where presidential candidates is planning wars with other nations
Over steak with Masons
Pregnant teens give birth to intelligent gangsters
They daddies faceless
Play this, by your stomach, let my words massage it and rub it
I'll be his daddy if there's nobody there to love it
Tell him his name Nasir, tell him how he got here
Mama was just having fun with someone above her years
Niggas is still hating
Talking that Nas done fell off with rhyming
He'd rather floss with diamonds
They pray ""Please God, let him spit that 'Uzi in the army lining'
That 'shorty doo-wop rolling oo-wops in the park reclining'""
Take 27 emcees, put 'em in a line and they're out of alignment
My assignment since he said retirement
Hiding behind 8 Mile and The Chronic
Gets rich but dies rhyming
This is high science
Now add 23 more from Queens to B-more
I'm over their heads like a bulimic on a seesaw
Now that's 50 porch monkeys ate up at the same time
Nasty Nasdaq, y'all gon' bow holmes, this Dow Jones
.80 cal chrome, needed time alone to zone
The mack left his iPhone and his nine at home
My queen used her milkshake to bring y'all to my slaughterhouses
I do this for the group home kids in boarding houses
This that ""nigga"" shit that's on the album
For them niggas inside the chalk line in 40 houses
Bring back Arsenio
Hip-hop was aborted so Nas breathes life, back into the embryo
Let us make man in our image, spit it
I'm Huey P in Louis V
At the eulogy throwing Molotovs for Emmett
And you ain't as hot as I is
All of these false prophets is not messiahs
You don't know how high the sky is
The square mileage of Earth or what pi is
I'm the shaky hand that touched George Foreman in Zaire
The same hand that punched down devils
That brought down the Towers18Embed"

From Willie Lynch to Willie Hutch, right on, we Superfly
Made Gucci the shit, Louie too, suits and ties
Player trophies, pray to Goldie
Picture wax museums full of Black Panth's and triple OGs
Aunt Jemina hoes, historic horse shit
Girls from long time ago, stagecoach with the horse, kid
Witchdoctors, good ol' pickpockets
Sip moonshine, so-called coons, shines, and darkies
I love y'all, pyramids to cotton fields
To Wrigley Fields, forgotten men who did get killed
Crispus Attucks, the first blasted
Peace to the rich lady purse snatcher shot in the back
I know your hunger kid, I know they hung your dad
Burnt ya mama crib, I know that hurt you bad
Minstrel shows, from gold to shackles and back to gold
We act like we home, matter of fact, we are home
Bad attitudes, octoroon skin tones
Slave food turned to soul food, collards to neck bones
Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag
Bet she had a nigga with her to help her old ass!

Better yet, ask PETA, whoever, which animal makes suede?
If not for suede, would you have survived the Dark Ages?
Cannibal ways of the ancient Caucasians
Stare you like you're steak tartar, pinot noir

He helped pave the way for Southern crankers and them Harlem shakers

Chronic leaf hitting, all kinds of heat with him, wisdom
From pot to piss in to high position
Intense hustle, it's pain like a pinched muscle
'Til it rains and my Timbs stain my socks
'Til I dodge enough shots and the presiding judge slams a mallet
And says life I'ma guap, then I cop
Then I yacht, then I dock
Island hopping away from nightmare holders
Or cowboy slingers, who shoot up any club
To see they names ring loud on some FBI poster
Must be on X or they coked up
Suggesting I post a, bail, I'm like, ""Yes"" 'cause we soldiers
We just getting older, in time, we still in our prime
I can't afford a new arrest on my folder

Plenty Henny in me, envy was simply they trend, see
My enemy was every hater that was bigger than me
The high life, the fly life
Pierre Hardy, imitation of Christ
Ice-wear gaudy, since '94 flossy
The Lex was an excellent choice now fast forward me
The pestilence of the ghetto informed me
As a shorty, to push nothing less than a 740
With fresh linen, sip Pellegrinos with Airs on
They sick, mixing they water with Airborne

Yeah, laced at Macy's, don't have it, a hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around, or I'm wasting fabric
I don't feel greater 'til my plush pieces, cause you to suck your teeth
So mean-mugging on my clean-thugging mean nothing
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry-writing Russian, ice disgusting
I started bling, how could you question my direction
Or my Tom Ford collection? Gangstas two-stepping
You hate me, should thank me, but lately
I burned so much trees, I keep environmentalists angry
I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder, your best success is my worst blunder
Y'all livin' trendy on pennies, I cop plenty Fendi
Vivienne Westwood, I'm good
Get the whole Trump Tower top floor for the hood
Dre & Cool, we riding heavy, NY to Miami 'cause

Now let's toast to the hustlers

And tell the ballers pour a glass for all us
We make the world go round

[Verse 2: The Game & Chris Brown]
I see the haters on the floor jocking my swag
I'm popping Ralph Lauren tags and pouring champagne inside a Polo glass
Model bitches rolling grass, Escobar unfolding cash
Toasting with my entourage, went from robbing armored cars
To all my stars, red carpet to the L'Ermitage
We throwing red dice at the Mirage
I pull that red Lamborghini on twenties out my garage
Set up shop in South Beach like Khaled and Terror Squad
(We The Best!) Big pimping, top down chrome spinning
""Top Gun"", Tom Cruise tucked inside my Gucci linen
No [censored], just Romo
You tryna shine, I put the nine on your jersey for promo
Jessica Simpson, that's so-so
Nick want his (baby back), but that's Loso
Tell Hawaii Five-O to catch me at the Pro Bowl
On the field, diamonds choking the jockey on my Polo
CB, let 'em know though

We make the world go round
Tell the hustlers to toast to the gangstas

Tell the gangstas to toast to the ballers

Ladies on the floor and all 'em two stepping
From L.A. to Harlem, two stepping
(From L.A. to Harlem, two stepping)
So iced out, it's easy to point them haters out

[Verse 3: Nas]
We start with Bellini's and end with Patrón shots
H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart
Alife tag popper, it'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags
Worth a hundred cash shopping
Violence only when have to, have to to swell you up
Prefer peach Schnaps, Perrier-Jouët, a vanilla dutch
Mets cap, that's Queens, I'm a vet, bet that
300 carats the average up on the neck, black
Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss
Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche
Top down, new fashion
Seeing me's like seeing through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera light flashing
And I'm laughing, my plaques' from album sales
Y'all is ringtone platinum but ninety-nine cents adds up
I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em
The new young Prince with young Mike Jackson on the same track

I can still see the dreams that my niggas ain't never lived to see
Tell them angels open the door for me
From nine Berettas and movin' raw
To chillin' in wine cellars, sticks and humidors

That's what I call a G, that's what I call a pimp
That's what I call a gangsta, to the fullest, shit

By every September 14th, that's my dream

Forgettin' Nas the only true rebel since the beginnin'
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow

With new ideas bein' told what they can and can't spit

If all I saw was gangsters coming up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung to
Claim to, I mold myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap? I'm a monster
Streets deceiving, can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata, persona's that of a non-needer
Cause I don't need nada 'cept for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer sleeveless
To my G's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up, a phoenix caked up
Trying to take what I'm eating came up
A dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy, mild, wild hardly
A man's man, who would've knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebels and Stella McCartneys
For years, all that, how can I not be dead?
This old German said I was a thug with a knotty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see, from my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme
My story is I'm from the home of the thieves

Who's the God of suckers and snitches? The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive, Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder, black cop, cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers athletes and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances, trends and fashion?
But when it comes to residuals, they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even in white tees, blue jeans and red bandanas

Assassinations, diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people built a new nation
Involuntary labor, took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby, let her man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700s
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite through your covenant
Love to sit on the Senate, and tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair, she read about herself in the Bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her, with an apron like, ""Bring me my dinner dear""
She the 'nigga' here, ain't we in the free world?
Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls
Barbarity, I'm in the double-R casually
Bugging how I made it out the hood, dazzle me
How far are we really from third world savagery?
When the empire fall, imagine how crazy that'll be

The video slots broadcasting Waco Davidian plots
They own YouTube, MySpace
When this ignorant shit going to stop?
They monopolizing news, your views
And the channel you choose, propaganda, visual cancer
The eye in the sky, number 5 on the dial
Secret agenda, frequency antenna, Dr. Mindbender
Remote control, soul controller, your brain holder
Slave culture, game's over
What's a fox characteristic? Slick shit, censored misinformation
Pimp the station, over-stimulation
Reception, deception, Comcast digital Satan
The fox has a bushy tail
And Bush tells lies and fox-trots
So, I don't know what's real (what's real)
[Chorus]
Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from the Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say, Big Brother is watching
Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from the Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say, Fox Five is watching

O'Reilly? Oh really? No rally needed, I'll tie you up
Network for child predators, setting them up

Y'all exploit rap culture, then y'all flip on us
And you own the Post, and y'all shit on us

They're going to try to censor my next verse
Throw them off the roof neck first
While I'm clicking my cursor
Reading blogs about pressure they put on Universal
It gets worse
While I'm clicking my mouse, while they kick in my house
They figured us out, why a nigga go south?
It's either he caught a body
Don't sleep, they're watching
I watch CBS, and I see BS
Trying to track us down with GPS
Make a nigga want to invest in PBS (see BS)

But what about Grindhouse and Kill Bill?
What about Cheney and Halliburton?

How is Nas the most violent person?
Y'all don't know talent if it hit you
Bringing up my criminal possession charges with a pistol
I use Viacom as my firearm
Then let the lyrics split you, who do you rely upon?
Then shoot shells at Leviath-o-n
I'm dealing with the higher form
Fuck if you care of how I write a poem
Only fox that I loved was the Red one
Only black man that Fox love is in jail or a dead one
Red rum, political bedlam
Don't let the hype into your eyes and ear drum
Murdoch owns Fox, not A-Team with Baracus
And he hates Barack cause he march with the marches
[Interlude: Deep voice]
I pledge allegiance to the fair and balanced truth
Not the biased truth
Not the liest truth

I will not be deceived
Nor will I believe in the propaganda

They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you looking for? You the question and the answer

[Verse 1]
We trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us
Powdered eggs and government cheeses
The calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus
Gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers
Schools with outdated books, we are the forgotten
Summers, cooling off by the fire hydrant
Yeah I'm from the ghetto
Where old black women talk about their sugar level
It's not unusual
To see photos of dead homies funerals
Aluminum foil on TV antennas
Little TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners
Girls dye their hair with Kool-Aid
They gave us lemons, we made lemonade
But this nigga's paid, ancestry of slaves
Descendant of kings, it's necessary I - bling
Put rims on everything, wear Timbs on every scene
[Chorus]
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you looking for? You the question and the answer

[Verse 2]
Do I mean it like a slave master, nigga?
No I'm gangsta, gotta eat rappers
My abbreviation was young when I caught the cases
That should mean the court could see my changes
Take off the bracelets
Savage when broke, smoke sour diesel, need no Bowflex
My chest still cut up like a bag of dope
Thought patterns consist of boss matters
Spit Moses' lost commandments like a gross sandwich out my mouth
Toast to government cameras peeping us, every week I must
Have my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs
But this is what I was dreaming of
Between cutting hard coke with new razors slicing my fingers up
They used to string us up, we wanted everything
But the one bringing us cake be the snakes like the
Like the New Jack City wedding scene
No time for mistakes, trying to get it like Medellin
[Chorus]
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you looking for? You the question and the answer

[Verse 3]
My nig', what up my nig'? Yep!
People afraid of criticism
But I always put myself in a sacrificial position
They been know I ain't just rapping for fame
I got my old homie's half-sister father asking for chains
Yep, I give the cash up, this paper don't matter
They see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war
They got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more
So now my enemies are at my front door
'Cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence
They calling it reverse racism
Still to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung'
I'll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me
You'll always know where to find me
They say the close ones will hurt you
So let's keep a small circle
On the road to riches and diamond rings
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king
[Chorus]
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master

""They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan
They were trying to touch on and thieve envy within the leadership
But as a general and a man that rose through the ranks through discipline
His presence inspired those men with the discipline he imposed on his own life
Louis Farrakhan""

[Verse 1]
Uhh, yeah, wow..
No revolutionary gets old or so I'm told
You're left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me
I heard gun shots rang; his bullet's got my name
I ain't see 'em take aim, I dreamt this day came
'Cause I stood in the face of damnation
Satan spat at 'em, flat out disgraced 'em
He want my blood, why me?
Why not the fake ones who deserve death, man?
Fuck it, I'll take one, 'cause stop me
But can't stop a whole nation of millions who feel you deceived them
They believe in reparation makes it even
So I'm deadly now because of one reason, they listening
In Budapest, Japan, China, and Switzerland
We getting it in son
Another bullet pass by, missed me
Wondering who plotting to get me?
Alphabet boys still plotting against me
To hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history
You won't remember why they came to clip me
When time go by you'll soon forget me
They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and Bentleys
Then they use one of my lines just to prove I'm guilty
Don't let 'em kill me...

Some revolutionaries do live long
Am I one of them? Guess we'll know in due time
Everybody has rights, can I use mine?
Can I rock shine? Can I have a girl that's too fine?
Got a swell life, tell me will I lose mine?
Every time I turn around somebody new dying
Let's start living, À la carte, Escargot
Escobar, invest my millions
Mansion for the wife, the rest for the children
Knowing that they coming anytime
But until then, i'm at large till they shoot me
Million dollar stones in my camouflaged Gucci
Giving you this crack like Pookie
To question the system, be the resistance
No matter what color you are, everybody niggers
Or you can stand by or watch or you can march on with us

You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free

Hahaha, shit is all true

[Verse 1: Nas]
Mmm, fried chicken, fly vixen
Give me heart disease but need you in my kitchen
You a bird but you ain't a ki'
Got wings but you can't fly away from me
Driving in your bucket seats, all the way from Kentucky to fuck with me
Look what you done to me, was number one to me
After you shower, you and your gold medal flour
Then you rub your hot oil for about a half an hour
You in your hot tub, I'm looking at you salivating
Dry you off, I got your paper towel waiting
Lay you down 'cause you're red hot
Louisiana style you make my head rot
Then I flock to the bed then plop, when we done, I need rest
Don't know what part of you I love best
Your legs or your breast
Mrs. Fried Chicken, you gon' be a nigga death
Created by southern black women to serve massa' guest
You gon' be a nigga death
Mrs. Fried Chicken, you was my addiction
Dripping with high cholest-
Like Greeks with his falafel, Italian with his tomato pasta
What roti is to a rasta
Trapping me, you and your friend mac' and cheese
Candy yams, collard greens but you knocking me to my knees
It's killing me when I'm inside, nothing I need more than a fish fry
[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Shit, it taste good, I can't lie
It's like you're walking out the tanning salon
When I pull you out the oven from baking, I got you on my mind
Rubbing that sun tan lotion all up over your body
So amazing how you sparkle when I glaze you swine
Hey, my pretty ham hock
It's so feminine the way you submitted and how you gave me power
To massaging me to shower you with lemon water
Marinate you with seasoning and dipping you in chowder
Baby it's like you at the spa the way you gently lay in the pan
While enjoying your butter milk treatment
I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling on your skin
Despite the funny fragrance, still I lick my finger frequent
In any event, I'm reflecting on all the signs
That I got saying that I shouldn't fuck with you
But the way you that you would taste made you hard to resist
When I put my mouth on you but that's another issue
Butterflies up in my stomach, when I laid eyes on you
Or was it infection manifesting?
Confused over the feeling, impatiently eating you
Trichina worm chewing on the wall of my intestine
I'm a eat you 'til there's nothing left
Until my very last breath, you gon' be a nigga death
Despite I prepare it the best
And specialize in cooking swine as a chef, you gon' be a nigga death
Who cares if the swine's mixed with rat, cat and dog combined?
Yes, I'ma eat the shit to death
[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Ain't that some shit?
I'ma eat some shit until what I'm eating kills me
And I choose to do that, why?

It is absolutely silly, and unproductive
To have a funeral for the word ""nigga""

Not a funeral for niggers
Cause niggers - DON'T DIE {*echoes*}

Uh, yeah..
Yo, I'm creepy and crawlin', in your sink and your toilet
I be drinkin' from your spit, anything cause I'm all less
An insect with four legs; people come in, I fake dead
Correction: I got eight legs, climbin' on top yo' plate, bed
Wherever I smell food, it could be even jail food
Stale food that's molded, a roach is what I am, fool
The ghetto is my land, fool, I'ma never be able to
Fly like a bumblebee, try not, to be underneath
Your sneaker, pitiful creature, I'm not afraid of
Your pesticide or RAID cause, in heaven's my Creator
I love it when the light's off, eatin' from same knives, forks
From, any man's dinner, see my antennas
You can't win, you can't stand the crunchy sound I make
If you squash me, learn to live with me
How much your roach motel costin' you in the city?
But yo, we everywhere, check your house good, I bet we there!

13.0,Y’all My Niggas,Nas (Untitled),2008,"Y’all My Niggas Lyrics[Intro: sample]
We use the word everyday
Now we don't know the capacity of this word
Are we headed for conflict or not? (Yes sir)
Because we did not break down the capacity
Of the same what (the same word)
Brothers and sisters, this is why we hung up the consciousness
We've been taught wrong

[Verse 1]
Find a room to lock yourself in and close the door
It's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore
We gotta, strip the word down rugged and raw
The rhetoric of Martin King just ain't around no more
Du Bois ain't here, James Baldwin neither, they all were leaders
But they ain't help me get this Porsche two seater
A lawyer left the hood, he never looked back
To be a Fortune 500 CEO, it took rap
So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back?
The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack
Marketing companies is hiring blacks
Fresh hip-hop lingo for your campaign ads
Controversy surrounds who could say it and when
Some niggas are full time, some play and pretend
So fuck that, no apologies on the issue
If it offends you, it's meant to, it's that simple
[Chorus]
Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)
Speak my name and breathe life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!)
And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject, 'cause y'all my niggas

[Verse 2]
Yo, I was thinking a little bit
What would it take to authenticate my nigganess?
Ball ridiculous? 26 inches when I call up the dealership?
Aww, that's some nigga shit
We only out for our own benefit?
We having too many kids? We Claudines? Welfare recipients?
The infamous free clinics is the sickest shit
Make me think what the hell they clean they syringes with
Everybody bleeding, the cops are the demons
Courtrooms full of goons, jail buses leaning
Handcuffs squeezed too tight on youth life
If you fight, they just give in, people used to do sit ins
They got Nigeria and Niger, two different countries
Somehow Niger turned to nigga, and shit got ugly
The problem is we started thinking like the colonists
'Til Noble Drew Ali started dropping that consciousness
[Chorus]
Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)
Speak my name and breathe life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!)
And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject, 'cause y'all my niggas

[Verse 3]
My father was not a banker, neither was my neighbor
When it came to getting paper, who the hell was gon' train us?
Oppression couldn't escape us through the ages
We changed the basis of derogatory phrases
And I say it's quite amazing
The use of ghetto terms developed our own language
No matter where it came from
It's celebrated, now people are mad if they ain't one

[Interlude: sample]
Every word we use, it has a capacity
And if you don't understand the words you're using
And understand the capacity of it
You are using words that is creating a destiny for you
That you don't even know, or even conscious of

You can see it in the weather

What you do comes back to you

Uhh, uhh
Confucius, Confucius, Sigmund Freud
And Farad Muhammad, is it evolution or God?
Searching for the truth is a threat
Seems the closer we get to the truth State Troopers or Feds
Come out to silence you, my house in Malibu probably tapped
'Cause living next door to Demi Moore, plus I'm black
Plus I want vengeance for the poor who's attacked daily
Patriot Act never scared me
Jake in the Taurus, sticky in the jar-as
Niggas I'm with got warrants
America's browning, 20 years from now every town'll be brown and Latin
An African looking Manhattan
I'ma tell you what I seen with my three eyes
Word to me, not a hoax back in '99
A spacecraft in the skyline
In L.A. in daytime, ask Horse if I'm lying

Raise your sons and your daughters
With respect and with honor
From the seed comes a fruit

Right on earth anthropologists are finding shit

'Cause we was deprived of it, suffered
Now we pop to prove anything's possible
My pimp strut was invented when they whipped us
Now we diddy bop just to show you that our strength's up
Just when niggas 'bout to see they cut
Global warming about to burn us up
Niggas never really seen paper in this world
American blacks, the teenager of this world
Give us 20 more years to grow up, already geniuses
What I mean is this
I used to worship a certain Queens police murderer
'Til I read the words of Ivan Van Sertima
He inserted something in me that made me feel worthier
Now I spit revolution, I'm his hood interpreter

Lending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it

Loading up mine too, ready to ride

Of all races and colors to erase the hate

Now I'm defending Vick, and free that nigga T.I.P
I'd take the grave or a bid
Then let some dirty clan members run up in my crib
And plant cracks on the man that's going to church
Plants packs on the man that's going to work
And build cases, meanwhile they daddies and they brothers
Is recruiting all my brothers and cousins to fill bases
The nerve of y'all to call Escobar a racist

1.0,As We Enter,Distant Relatives,2010,"As We Enter Lyrics[Produced by Damian Marley]

[Verse 1: Damian Marley & Nas]
As we enter
Come now, we take you on the biggest adventure
Must be dementia
That you ever thought you could touch our credentials
What's the initials?
Q.B., Jamrock—the lyrical official
Send out the order, laws and the rituals
Burn candles, say prayers, paint murals
It is truth, we big news, we hood heroes
Break past the anchor, we come to conquer
Man a badman, we no play Willy Wonka
And I got the guns, I got the ganja
And we could blaze it up on your block if you wanna
Or haze it up, stash-box in a Hummer
Or you could run up and get done up
Or get somethin' that you want none of
Unlimited amount you collect from us
Direct from us, street intellectuals
And I'm shrewd about decimals
And my man'll speak Patois, and I can speak rap star
Y'all feel me even if it's in Swahili
Habari Gani, Mzuri Sana
Switch up the language, I move through Ghana
Salute and honor, real revolution rhymers
Rhythm piranhas like two Obamas, unfold the drama
[Hook: Nas]
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream ""murder"" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain when dude comin'
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it

[Verse 2: Damian Marley & Nas]
Queens to Kingston
Gunshot we use and govern the kingdom
Rise of the Winston, I can see the fear up in your eyes
Realize you can die any instant
And I can hear the sound of your voice
When you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen
Snitchin', I can see him pissin' on hisself
And he's wettin' up his thighs and he tryin' to resist it
Switchin', I can smell him diggin' up shit like a fly
Come around and be persistent
That's how you end up in a hit list
In a badman business
No evidence, crime scene fingerprint-less
Flow effortless, casual like the weekends
No pressure when we're comfy and decent
We set this off beastin', huntin' season
And, frankly speakin'
[Hook: Nas]
Word is out, hysteria, you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong came to turn it out
Body the verse until they scream ""murder"" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain when dude coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong came to turn it out
Body the verse until they scream ""murder"" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain when dude coming

Every man deserve a turn like a flame deserve to burn
Tribal war, a nuh dat we a defend
Each and every man deserve to earn
And every child deserve to learn
Tribal war, a nuh dat we a defend
Every man deserve a turn, like Babylon deserve to burn
[Verse 1: Nas]
Man what happened to us?
Geographically they moved us from Africa
We was once happiness-pursuers
Now we back stabbing, combative and abusive
The African and Arab go at it they most Muslim
Used to be moving in unison, disputes would end
Bounty hunters and grape street get cool again
Sub-standard housing, got the young running rampant
Wilding, for a Phantom he can style in
Mask on his face, grabbing his Ruger
Saying nobody move or I'll shoot you
Man you're expiring, catch 25 and he does it like a man
He sides with black, white pride and Mexican
Survive the best he can, strap a shank to his thigh
Why do we all collide? Why do the young die?
Extortion, murder and burglary, tattoos his chest
Says his enemies don't deserve to breathe

I drink poison then I vomit diamonds
I gave you Mandela, black Dalai Lamas
I gave you music, you enthused in my kindness
So how dare you reduce me to Donny Imus
Timeless in case we never been acquainted
Flyness who made it, it gets duplicated
Mindless violence, well let me try to paint it
Here's the 5 steps in hopes to explain it
ONE: It's me and my nation against the world
TWO: Then me and my clan against the nation
THREE: Then me and my fam' against the clan
FOUR: Then me and my brother we no hesitation, uh
Go against the fam' until they cave in
FIVE: Now who's left in this deadly equation?
That's right, it's me against my brother
Then we point a Kalashnikov and kill one another

Man a war tribal over colors
Over money, over land, and over oil, and over god
And over idols, and even lovers
Over breakfast, over dinner, over suppers
Over jungle, over rema, over buckers
Over Brooklyn, over Queens, and over Rutgers
Over red, and over blue, and over chuckers
Over red and over blue and under covers
Tribal trouble, the drive-bys double
Cause the youth dem nah go war and go fight with knuckle
The two sides scuffle
Vietnam nah go a war with no more kung fu nun chuckle
Missile and shuttle
And the Queen of England and Uncle Sam
Dem a flex dem muscle

All I do is stay focused
Looking straight forward at the world and beyond
I feel people pulling me down
I feel some pulling me up
I can't get stuck
I just keep moving forward
I got places to go man
Let's go

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
When the armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak hearted wither and  moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Hey, the victory's found in truth
Like innocence found in youth
Self defeat is your own dispute
And man, you put yourself in your own shoes
Either you're winning or losing
Don't you get it confused
Play a star and you know your own movie
Playing of the role you choose, so
Stand up and fight if you know that you're right
And know you will never fail
Tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail
And the boat shall forever sail
Hey, there ain't no stopping or cruising
Even when you're battered and bruised
Outrun all the sprinters on Mount Olympus
My God's tougher than Zeus

[Chorus: Damian Marley (Nas)]
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
(I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan
(I get up and we get it cracking)

[Verse 2: Nas]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
New York to Cali, for the money, power, respect
It's a journey, some'll get left behind
Cause in life, you cannot press rewind
Get it right, you only have one first chance
To make one first impression that lasts a lifetime
Reputation supersedes itself
Do you believe in Hell? Babylon greed for wealth
Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell?
And disregard those who most need your help
Thick skin, the dark won't take my soul
Survive spiritual wars, see my welts
And the evil's felt, but the faith is stronger
I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster
But I clench my fists, ready to go against whoever
Tie my Timbs and rise in the end
[Chorus: Damian Marley (Nas)]
When the armageddon's dark and dread
(I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
(I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and tread
(I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan
(We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (yeah)
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you
[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
No man live forever, but never say never
Every good he want better, must be a go getter
And always be clever in every endeavor
Cause drastic time call for drastic measure
Yuh birthright to pleasure From yuh navel string sever
The land and the treasure, work for whatever
Jah said don't be a beggar, the Alpha Omega
Will bless every soul no matter which name you prefer
The immortal stepper, believe in every skin no matter which color they are
We never let we don't know here which kind of weather
You're destined to rise like the Son of Rebecca
Don't stop for a second
Everyone reckon, it sure would be good to be there
Whether Zion or Mecca
When the gates are finally closed
And the saints go marching in

[Chorus: Damian Marley & (Nas)]
When the armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak hearted wither and  moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you


[Verse 4: Nas]
I'm a street lifer
Always harrassed by the cee cyphers
Chief like Geronimo with his peace pipe
I emerged from the street life
This for the homies who relate
Know what it be like
My QB life takin' a turn to the Louis XIII life
Twisted and mangled sort of like Bruce Lee life
Cursed with his son Brandon
If that's you and me, Knight, I pray our fates greater
I speak life I still matter as a rapper, not doubtin'
Even Toni Braxton signed a deal with Craig Kallman
How in, the hell am I supposed stay comfy
When I pay child support, alimony monthly?
Got Maseratis and Ferraris
Only like a woman who's a rider, But only ho's want me
Single life crazy, niggas wives on me
I say stay faithful, they say their man corny
So I'm, stuck with a married woman
So fine, cheatin while they husband
Rushing on the 40-yard line, wonder if
This is what my ex did the whole time
Good niggas seem to always end up
With some hard times, hope not
If a pimp slippin and a ho plot
Ain't nothin to a G in a two-tone drop, kid
And it don't stop, See a nigga dissapearin
With the baddest honeys in the whole spot, yeah13Embed"

Jake hate him, snakes could not violate him
Pimps memorize his lines verbatim
He reps N.Y., yo
Gives C-notes to winos
Not church, it's how he tithe though
He walks the tenement
Sleeps at his super fly condo
My kinda nigga, my Icon, my idol
No certificate for this misfit who handle business
The odds stacked against him
He fights back mackin' Benzes
Never puts cash or ass before friendship
He laughs last?
As some die young, he is still existin'
Somehow he got around the pitfalls of the system
When he walks, we watch
When he talks, we listen

I can see myself back at the Autobahn
Malcolm on the podium, shells drop to linoleum
Swipe those, place 'em on display at the Smithsonian
Next to only gems that were left behind by holy men
Infectious charisma of those who gave us direction
The anti-sexists
Resistance against oppression
Progressive thinkin'
Ghetto speakers
Protestors against the colored
Only section to the Jena 6 and
The Frost Nixon

The cross, the crucifixion
The loss we took for sinnin'
On Esau's back inscription
That it was written
That nothing is coincidence'n

And the years them carry on and I miss you even more
Still I send them go to school and tell them

Another year has come and past, man a drop like morning dew
Uncle Warrick sick and gone when him couldn't catch a flu

Only talking with winners, a loser or two got my number
Still they think they real but they just really awfully bitter
Salty niggas hate the smarter ones, these are the doubters
Who sour 'bout my run, I barely made it out the slums
My value high 'cause I do more than rap about a gun
I made money for niggas, y'all never looking out for none
I helped millionaires get to that very position
Some real millionaires see that's ill 'cause look at statistics
Real millionaires and I ain't talking ghetto riches, thorough business
You mistreating niggas, heard your folks bleed in prison
You ain't a G and if you was I don't recall
Who would roll with y'all, bunch of fucking know it  alls who's dough is small
Look what's it come to our rapport's good no more
We was good before till I saw what type a dude you took me for
We had a chance to take paper down, what I took was more
Because of hatred, opportunity wasted

Keep your vision clear cause only a coward lives in fear

No jealousies, no feminine tendencies, we expecting
No gossip, no phony logic, no counting your homey pocket
Spare no expense for legal defense if your homey locked up
No keeping tabs on who was the last who looked out

O Gosh
Ye the Promise Land
Yeaha the Promise Land

[Verse 2: Nas]
Promised Land, I picture Porsches
Basquiat Portraits
Pinky Rings, realistic princesses, heiresses, bunch a Kings and Queens
Plus I picture fortunes for kids out in Port-Au-Prince
Powerless they not allowed to fit, but not about to slip
Vision Promised Land with fashion like Madison Ave, Manhattan
Saks 5th Ave and Rodeo, Relaxing popping labels
Promise Land no fables, this where the truth's told
Use them two holes above your nose
To see the proof yo!
Imagine a contraption that could take us back when
The world was run by black men
Back to the future, anything can happen
If these are the last days
And 100-foot waves come crashing down
I get some hash and pounds, pass around the bud then watch the flood
Can't stop apocalypse, my synopsis is catastrophic
If satellites is causing earthquakes
Will we survive it?
Honestly man it's the sign of the times and the times at hand
[Hook 3: Dennis Brown]
There's alot of work to be done, O gosh
In the Promised Land
In the Promised Land
O Gosh
Take me to The Promise Land
Ye the Promise Land
O Gosh now
To the Promise Land
Hey

[Verse 3: Dennis Brown]
There's plenty of land for you and I
Buy and Buy
Lost of food to share for everyone
No time for segregation

[Hook 4: Dennis Brown]
In the Promised Land
Yes a to the Promised Land
The Promised Land
Going to The Promise Land
Ooo
There's a lot of work to be done, oh Gosh, in the Promised Land6Embed"

[Verse 1: Nas]
Two steps away from death, a vest and a holster
I detest detectives arresting us over
Weapons possession, they was checking the Rover
Inspecting the Tattoos on my neck and my shoulder
How many times I'm one of six coffin holders
Or I'm, sitting with goons in the visiting rooms
Flip it I could have been you, behind state walls biddin'
These are the things that a G pray for
Acquit us, a little stash in the safe or little Shorty to wait for him
Or a Shorty to take the weight for him
What really did I escape from?
Thought I saw Gods face on the design in my vintage Claiborne
Swear I see Him every day y'all
In a bus or the train or
The billboards out there that hang tall
I still give thanks for Him
Have faith for Him, no matter what His name's called
Seen!

Can you think of a color that you never seen?
Can you reminisce on places you never been?
Well is many are called, but them never deemed
Worthy for the cause, cause them never clean
Help who help themselves, Jah nuh raffle dream
That's why me chummy with Jah Jah like a Cherubim
Keep we strong through the winter like an Evergreen
And all of us are more connected than it ever seemed
All things are related, and creation is a package
Generate together and we increase the wattage
A how them a go manage?
Tell Babylon them can't do Rasta damage, nor stop we through the passage
Jah did make a promise, God is always honest
Always keeps his word, Yow nuh care what the plan is
Don't be astonished, Stumbling blocks vanish
One day the meek gonna live inna di palace
Woah!

Some ask me if I feel that Zion is surreal
And in my songs, do I plan to expose and reveal
Word to the curb that's under these chrome wheels
My homies is the only ones I'm taking care of
But severe reality starts to become more clear
And these know-it-all rappers have become more weird
As if they were superior and fans are inferior
How I balance between the streets and the theories of
Collegiate literature, I hold mirrors up
Give combinations of pain, joy, fear and love
Through my perspective, I can see Jah reflection
In the highest definition, getting high with my brethren
Then I ask him why is Africans dying from circumcision
They lack proper surgeons and suffer malnutrition
Underestimate the wealth of their own wisdom
Its like its been exchanged for this penicillin

[Interlude: Nas]
Hey yo D
Let's go all the way in on this one

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Some of the smartest dummies
Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies
An' a fly go a moon
And can't find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths
Cause it's not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo
Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money
This is how the media pillages
On the TV the picture is
Savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids, huh
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images
And this is what the image is
You buy a khaki pants
And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
An' a thief out the gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see
And that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the West
Will never move East
And feel like they could be at home
Dem get tricked by the beast
But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord
[Chorus]
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô

[Interlude: Nas]
Yeah, Sabali. Thats patience. That's what the old folks told me
Discovering the World before this World. A World buried in time
Uncover with rhymes. It gets no realer

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?
Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?
Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off
Now the Earth is round
If the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things
That he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out
The root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze
And that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut
Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wet mud
Can you read signs? can you read stars?
Can you make peace? can you fight war?
Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh
Can you survive? Against all odds, now?
[Chorus]
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye

[Interlude: Nas]
It's crazy when you feed people the truth you don't know how they're gonna react
You're scared of wrong doers, people that just ignorant
You're scared of the truth, be patient for now

[Verse 3: Nas]
Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?
And was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the Earth
And then dinosaurs were born? damn
Who made up words? Who made up numbers?
And what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it
Microwaved it and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hue? What's man? What's human?
Anything along the land we consuming
Eatin', deletin', ruin
Trying to get paper
Gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson
Watch niggas play the game like the Lakers
In a world full of 52 fakers
Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders
Make a wish for the day cuz
Like somebody got a doll of me
Stickin' needles in my arteries
But I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like 'part of me, but I got a real big spirit'
I'm fearless, I'm fearless
Don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms
Felt their body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place
If this is how we gotta go?

Because the elders sow the seed and it a-germinate
So anytime them see the progress, them a-celebrate
Because we rising up despite of the economy
And then a-we a-star the show like the astronomy
And how we keep on breaking through is an anomaly
Because we keep remaining true without apology
The mission have fi carry through and finish properly
Say Gambia to Guadeloupe, Paris to Napoli
Say Zambia to Honolulu, back to Tripoli
And everybody want a future living happily

Can you blame my generation? Subjected gentrification
Depicting their frustrations over ill instrumentation
'Cause music is the way to convey to you what I'm facing
Placing my life in front of your eyes for your observation
Now if you can't relate then maybe you are too complacent
Athletes today are scared to make Muhammad Ali statements
What's up with tomorrow? Will you lead? Will you follow?
Improve your values, education is real power
I reach 'em like Bono, so get rid of your self sorrow
Add some bravado, get wealthy like Wells Fargo
It's truth that I am you and I am proof
Surviving through, we do what we gotta do
Yo, we could break the cycle, let nobody lie to you
Then maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school
'Cause there's a mission, we gotta finish before we leave
This generation is destined to do historic deeds

If you weather that storm, then that rain bring sun
Been a long time coming, I know change gone come (We're makin' a change)
Man, I gotta keep it moving to the beat of my drum
Last night I set the future at the feet of my son
But they thinking that my generation gotta die young
If we all come together then they can't divide one
Don't worry 'bout it, just be about it
Got a message from God: ""Heaven too crowded""
But I say, ""Hey, young world, you never looked better
And I heard change start with the man in the mirror,"" uh
This generation, I'mma represent
A generation led by a black president
Now how's that for change? Who knew that can change?
I don’t even look at the flag the same, heck
Uh, so when you finish reading Revelations
Thank God for my generation

Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones
Who are we today? yeah, now

[Verse 1: Nas, Damian Marley]
The black oasis, Ancient Africa the sacred
Awaking, the sleeping giant, science, art is your creation
I dreamed that we could visit old Kemet
Your history is too complex and rigid for some Western critics
They want the whole subject diminished
But Africa's the origin of all the world's religions
We praise bridges that carried us over
The battle fronts of Sudanic soldiers
The task put before us, do you hear me now?

For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come

Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones
Who are we today?

[Verse 2: Nas]
Who are we today? The slums, diseases, AIDS
We need that all to fade, we cannot be afraid
So who are we today?
We are the morning after, the makeshift youth
The slave ship captured, our diaspora is the final chapter
The ancestral lineage built pyramids
America's first immigrants
The kings, sons and daughters from Nile waters
The first architect, the first philosophers
Astronomers, the first prophets and the doctors were us, us

[Bridge: Damian Marley]
Now can we all pray? Each in his own way
Teaching and learning, we can work it out
We'll have a warm bed, we'll have some warm bread
Shelter from the storm dread and we can work it out
Mother nature feeds all in famine and drought
Tell those selfish in ways, not to share us out
What's a tree without root? Lion without tooth?
A lie without truth? You hear me out!
[Hook: Damian Marley]
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones
Who are we today? yeah, Lord

What tomorrow may bring. may some more love come
Yesterday we were kings, I tell ya young bloods
The world is yours today...

Or Obeah, your phobia, you paro
Your path narrow like climbing Mountain Kilimanjaro
Ancient men traded cattle
Before Columbus was lost in travel, ancient canoes got paddled
Before the horse saddle there was camel
Spears before arrow, arrow before ammo
Tribal paint before camo-
Flage, chief before sarge, or lieutenant
Village elders before the Senate
Used to sail the seas before the compass was invented

Embarrassed but managed to get a plate...
We was kids hungry
Mom's working, I was famished
She getting home late...
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full or starve
Corner store like ""Mister, spare-a-quarter""
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
Fifteen, I got a gun
Sixteen, I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun
What's got inside my brain?
A hustler's job ain't done, til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the midst of
Dudes who switch up and change
They wanna carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them though, I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow

Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani

Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas
They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, Nas did this
Pointing to they scars like, right here, baby, really Nas did this
Like a badge of honor, not bragging I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothing's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey

Shattering your silence, passing round the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery

What, Nasty, what, recollect motherfucker

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
At seventeen I made seventeen thousand living in public housing
Integrity intact, repping hard
They asking how he disappear and reappear back on top
Saying Nas must have naked pictures of God or something
To keep winning is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathing, I'll take chances
A soldier coming home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good 'cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smiling, I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like Trump being up down up, play with cash, huh

[Break: Large Professor]
My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we pushed it, mush it
Queensbridge to Bushwick
Harlem, Bronx, all that
You ain't even supposed to be here
You know where you at?
[Verse 3: Nas]
At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hanging from the roof of my mouth
Shit was felicissimo melting pot, city sweltering hot
Staggering, drunker than them cops that 2Pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed reaching
Soon as I heard them iron wheels screeching
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Token man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor thief shit, minor league shit, beasting
Looking for the juks young, but now we older chiefing
In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick
Bugging on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alcohol aging my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I, must be, something in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all

[Outro: Nas]
This for my trapped in the 90s niggas
For my trapped in the 90s niggas
Ha for y'all niggas12Embed"
3.0,A Queens Story,Life Is Good,2012,"A Queens Story Lyrics[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Verse 1]
Uhh, rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica Queens in his black truck
Timbs was forty below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal
Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you
In front of you
It’s foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money too, the fucking truth
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad
I could’ve died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November 30th, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up, y’all
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors, eight street, twin buildings
Vernon, can’t even count the Livingston children
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap though
Bridge niggas be up in Petey’s ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo, welcome home Castro
Queensbridge unified all I ask for
Let's do it for DU, say what up to Snacks, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through, uhh...
[Verse 2]
Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery
Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries
You be starving in Kew Gardens
Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team on 118
My nigga Bim fly by like it's a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock and Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough
(You all know how the story GO!)

[Verse 3]
""Any other real niggas in the world besides us?"" I ask
Probably is, but odds are we’ll never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, I see you DU
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends
Crack the Patrón, Hennessy and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow
I'm a real OG 'cause back in '93
Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddie’s gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now
But you know I'm still mental but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling
[Verse 4]
Watch the calm realest channel his mom's spirit
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Better stay on point, if not it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me probably
If music money didn't stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit
Bo cooking blow, fuck is Slate at? Where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling13Embed"

You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you coming, he ran when you tried to blast that man
Missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of 'em pull through but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, 'cause of a

We grew up doing graffiti, now hollow heads getting heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly getting weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck em all, we balling 'til they come lock us up
20 to life; I'm clubbing, blowing 20 tonight
We the mob, Bob Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a TEC off the shelf, live forever; that's Insh'Allah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer
You niggas accidental, shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodging my clique
Cut a check; I use your bitch for some bargaining chips
In a hole, sell your home, nigga go sell your soul
This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't

How they gon' kill that beautiful sister?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessing
Tell me who you impressing
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playing wrestling
Watch em grow to a man, I see them now they repping
But they cold-blooded, homie, wondering where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they're killing, they're reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?

Think of my nigga Drawz, but you aren't a name to me

Check it out
I call it, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters
[Verse 1]
I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin' with it

[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
[Verse 2]
This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said: ""Nas, go and get your kid!""
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they're too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls

[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
[Verse 3]
And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
‘Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters

DJ Hot Day...

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself
[Verse 1: Nas]
3:45AM can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive?
Guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep making my millions
Can see myself in Presidential campaign dinners
But I'm passing blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And outgrow women you loved and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil
All you need is some skill, then it’s grind time
Imagination better than knowledge, says Einstein
It’s all in the mind
Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute after it's heard
You all'll recite it, you all'll repeat it
You'll call me a genius, if you didn't
Now that I said it I forced you to think it
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moët
Bitch when you vision me, you vision the best
When I was young they called me Olu's son
Now he's Nas' father, I was the good seed
He was the wise gardener
[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yeah, what y'all know about this..
Yo, beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas
Conservatives don’t understand slang linguistics
The burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious
Get out a gangsta's business, seems to me your thoughts are basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker
Dope fiend neighbors, growing up I seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my British Knights can rival your Foamposites
Don’t make me pull my Lottos out the closet
Ha ha ha

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby

So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home

Lies and the pain
Betrayal, life

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
In danger’s face
Look what you’re facing, gave your heart away
And all the remedies couldn’t ease the pain
All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away
In a world so cold
You gain your life just to lose your soul
Never thinking twice bout what the future holds
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for
[Refrain: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uhh, snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest
Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
They deny me that, they know the bullets they loan me
Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat
Stretched out, letter T, it's better to dead a beef
Than let it breathe, then we don't succeed
Cause then you gotta murder dummies
Waste your time, they allergic to money
I'm never squirmish to blood
We can thug and get out of hand; what’s the options?
Only conclusion is shooting, bullets popping, hoodlums dropping
Fear any day that the Feds will come knocking
Was young and nervous, asking myself what’s my purpose?
In the back of a paddy wagon, bracelets aching me
Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me
These cops can’t relate to me, death to prison, empty vacancy

[Refrain: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me
[Verse 2: Nas]
Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments
Know a billionaire, he has everything but a fam
Guess how angry this man gets
Had so many bad chicks in his bed, strange sex, same sex
Has addictions that are sadistic, chain of events, habits
He puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
Self-esteem needs boosting, alcohol consumption
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms
All along he’s into beastiality porn
And it’s wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong
And I'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
And these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
Fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high
So they find dough to mainline dope, and y'all know

[Refrain: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 3: Nas]
So many vices, habits, mine of course, bad chicks
My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
I'm just rebellious, not selfish
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
I need the best things in life, that's women, that’s cars, cigars
A vintage bottle on ice that’s priceless
The other night, just in the emergency room
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
He can barely concentrate cause he’s newly separated
His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
In the house they were married in, mad people waiting
Some young some old, heads and stomachs aching
Filling out an application cause they all need medication
But the doctor need love or a quick vacation
Calling up his travel agent, same time, premeditating
Murdering his ex wife; life, savage ain't it
Some need Xanax just to maintain it
We all need faith cause the world keep changing
Let go of the illusion, start some restraining
[Outro: Anthony Hamilton]
Oooooooooooh-ahhhhhhhhh....
Ahhhhhhhh-ahhhhhh-ahhhhhh...ahhh..

Let's make a bet, I know the reason you ain't make it yet
Your stage was set, but you ain't see the tedious ingredients
That go inside of a rider, you hiding from problems and
You never knew how to make dollars
You couldn't make orders at a drive-through McDonald's
I was fly at the Apollo with Black Jason, '89 with a bottle
Niggas jealous of Jason, dark green seven forty, no tint
Rollie on wrist, gleaming, he rock the baldy
Used to ride with him to Brooklyn, Lewis and Halsey
Cop chocolate Thai, Vernon style and burn it down
My nigga Hype in the federal joint, verdict out
Twenty years getting money in the Dirty South
That's alleged, you see my nigga's a stand up dude
So I'm yelling, ""Free my nigga!""
My nephew godfather Malik, he jammed up too
For what his hands usually call for, but he ain't do it
[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from
Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Verse 2: Nas]
You ever been on the other end of a robber's revolver?
Not me, call me Lucky Nas Castellana
Or been shot in the medulla oblongata
And survived and praise God with a bullet I never collided
Some did and they lived, I salute the Gods
Moët spilling, splashed by mistake on my Timb boots for y'all
N.Y. nigga, Adidas, jogging suit
Shell toes, slim, fly nigga
Hudson River, rent a boat, t-shirt with a dinner coat
A vintage Fila like I'm the ghost of Domencio
On any day getting throat in a tinted vehicle
Like a old BK gangsta, but I'm the CEO
Of Nasty Nas Enterprises, mastermind, made men
My success symbolizes loyalty, great friends
Dedication, hard work, routine builds character
In a world full of snakes, rats and scavengers
Never make choices out of desperation, I think through it
Break through walls like Pink Floyd
And drink fluids, of all kind of alcohol, y'all
Vineyards in France, yachts out in Cannes
[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from
Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Verse 3: Nas]
Now holla at a millionaire
Rollie, Hublot and Audemar, deciding which one to wear
Who to screw, what to drive
550 with the cream guts inside
Or the Super Sport Range truck is fly
Diamond ring on my knuckles, like fire, bitch
Gats on us, I don't really trust these guys
Spend a couple bucks a night on bottles on cuties
If she beautiful, the lustful type, I'll hit it and bust inside
Fuck it, I'ma die one day
They gon' probably make that day a holiday
Until then, let's go on a shopping spree
Speaking for my real niggas
Only OGs, certified who kill niggas
When put in that seat, but tonight we on chill, nigga
Chill mode, spill more Spades
Listen to Yeezy and Hov, some Rozay
It's like we always on the grind with no brakes
So tonight we gon' act like we on vacation with this on rotation

Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am (word)
'Cause where I'm from (yeah)
Man, what I see you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
(Y'all wouldn't understand, huh)
No matter how you try you never can

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, yeah
The ill reminisce and think about the fly days
Nothing like them 80s summer NY days
Hop on the MB5 days
Mopeds, Pro Keds, city split five ways
How it all started, fifth floor apartment
A jigsaw puzzle aerial view of the projects
A kid saw struggle, buried a few of his partners
Now I chill in resorts, enjoying massages
Check out the oracle bred from city housing
Nas, I arise the dead by thousands
I remember seeing Shan chilling near his Audi (near his Audi)
Hollis had Run and them but I proudly
Put a poster up of Shan and Marley, that was art kid
You love to hear the story how it started
The bubbly I'm pouring wasn't popped yet
Before there was an audience to watch us
I assure you there was a process, yeah

[Verse 2: Nas]
To call them fake today is hate, real niggas extinct
Pac left me inside a rap world with niggas that wink
At other rappers, undercover niggas spit every way
Won't be surprised if all their rides have federal plates
Let alone their wardrobes and Studio 4 flow
It was real when I appeared, it would've been some jaws broke
Nas, my real name, stage name, same thing
How could you let these lames claim king, I'm so ashamed, man
I light a L for Vernon for niggas who would burn in Hell for Vernon
10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street
Pimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials
Of the ghetto queens, kings, stories true
Who possesses the testicular fortitude
To blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you
You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race
The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews
It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical
Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed
And it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve
That's why I hate doing interviews
But I don't sweat it, study long, study raw
My man Dion said Nas over-think the songs he writing
I'm not a wack performer standing near a corny hype man
I got the Donism in me, I'm here to enlighten

He's the heartbeat of the people
The ghetto people, and when I say ghetto people
The people who cannot afford to go to big concert
Some of these people do not even have TV, so they can't afford cable
Some of them can afford a radio
So the only thing they can listen to is the music
People the ghetto, people from the projects, street people
Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality

Hope I don't catch a homo, grossing our net

Heinous crimes behind me, search but can't find me
Fuck sadness, had this been you having this lavish
Habitual happiness, at me you wouldn’t look backwards
You would have sex on condominium roof decks
So anyone move next, I'll hit you with two TECs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli, no shirt on, convertible Mazi

Every tat mean something, that’s my word on my body
I’ll have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty

Yo, I used to listen to that Red Alert and Rap Attack
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that

Bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team
That long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans
Twenty years in this game, looking seventeen

[Verse 1]
Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas, family men, bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
That's what I named my son, Knight
He was born to be one, that's how my game was won
White 740 Bimmer, licked by an angel's tongue
I'm living dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watching, she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex, so I guess I'ma just.. stay

Even though I don't like you
Next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait do I got love for you?
I might kill you but do I got love for you?
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but it's love, what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me, I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures
Through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to.. stay

Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes, I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
[Verse 1: Nas]
I want someone who like the champagne I like, my a-alike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
For real, the world so ill, yo, I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease
You’re the woman I need, but where is she?

Yes, I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
[Verse 2: Nas]
I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question
What are they expectin'?
I be tryin' to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in?
They think forever I’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool to ask?
I’m well known, got people comin' at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
I'd gallivant around the Equator, if that would get me off the radar
It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo & Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris' with some lime, what is this?
An immaculate version of ""Me & My Bitch"" by Biggie
With all respect, 'cause you the only one that gets me

Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?

[Intro: Guy sample]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 1: Nas]
Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happens when you say I do, we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave – let it go, he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since I saw you screaming
""Hate you so much right now""
Should've saw the meaning, angry black woman
Actions of a demon, I'm leaving
[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 2: Nas]
Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet the cuter version, yet I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself – and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican, you got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like ""Ha, yo, look at my wife!""
Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened, and later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby, guess what...
[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 3: Nas]
Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half
Not some, but half, no, serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind
It’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was selfish cowards
Under their breath, saying, ""Why did Nas trust her?""
But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even alive
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again – it’s a beautiful life, aight?
Goodbye!
[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]
(Bye baby) Baby.. baby
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
I guess you knew and blew a good thing
You know I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

Ayo, late night, candlelight, fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of Scotch
Smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cutter'd
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars
Drop Rolls, hoes drop clothes
Louis the XIII, freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semi-automatic weapons I brought
The world crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince ‘em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and Skate Key, my jewelry in HD

Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage
I am the dragon

Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I'm so high I never land like Mike Jackson's crib
Vest on, .45 still crack ya rib, sacrilege
Talk trash 'bout the Nasty kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive
Talk money, is you jokin'?
Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got it
You envy, but don't offend me
I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me?
Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin' Tommy Montana from Queens had before the 90's
Drug dealer car, rush to the bar
Move, niggas! We don't give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them saggin'
Bet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black
Light another blunt in fact, haha...

And joinin' the blunt passin' you niggas was straight assin'
Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'

Been in them wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors

Proletarian chicks sparking
Convo weak and I don't really care for her jargon
Balcony is windy, looking at the stars and
Alky on the Henny, woozy in the head, wobbling
Gucci pillow on the bed, while she giving nogging
Listening and tripping off the Maxwell album
Thinking I should leave to a European island
Bristol and Spain, bring a book about Stalin
Dinner serenaded with a violin
But shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing
Gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit
Fine dining Olive Garden
Nah bitch, Nas is in the real deal
Food spots on the constant
Pick the right wine, a Chianti to wash it
Lifestyle encompasses top-notch watches
Rolexes, synonymous shit I'm copping
Ask her has she been around duffle bags
Full of that fuck you cash
Get off the jet with me in heels, I'll cup your ass
Looking in my eyes saying ""Nas, you're one lucky bastard""
Grip your clutch, you'll get finger fucked in the passenger
I hit the dutch, blow smoke out, music and laughter
See us in the coupe flying past ya

Esco, dress code, it changes

Back to the star spangled labels in my closet hanging
Counting wonder in the Tundra
Get humbled or disgruntled when I come through, confront ya
Let nothing slide, sly remarks, you must wanna die
But you fronting, why? When we all know you pumpkin pie
When we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates
To Dubai, to the Chi, I'm a crucial conflict
Heaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out
You are what a thug about, I'm a fucking juggernaut
Never sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up
Who don't speak, she quiet
So I can think, conspire
On my feet's a (?), and sometimes sneakers
Wear ties at the Setai Miami

I have no time to give you guidance
Barely have any fuck time either
Hefner minded like I think you're fine, but
I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver
Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her
Or if she insecure, most are
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off
Not a judge, 'cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows
My tax bracket, not enough blacks have it
Who should I date -- Project chick or Cuban actress?
A White chick, they might flip talking that Blackness
Should only attract Black shit, I'm an ass magnet
If you mad at that, you'll be mad forever
Never played you, I prayed we would stay together
Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean
Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams

I done went to hell and back, you always think you right
You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight
When people like my song, you want to kill 'em, right?
You resent me every time I make a million, right?
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot
Have your own cash, own your own Benz

Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee
Put you on under Martin Scorsese: Mean Street

At times I window watch at the Wynn hotel
Lots of thinking happens in life, will I win or fail?
Mind of a shooter, CFO also
Ethiopian food flown in, it's unlawful
Money is attractive, honey dress strapless
Agent Provocateur underwear: she's classic
Stroll up in the party: titanium black card
Romanian ladies like Casablanca, Casbah
'Cept we in the VIP area, that's ours
You know the real rap gods, typical trap star turned rap star
These old heads got stories, the days they was kings
I pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams
You 16, you could do 20, come home young
Catch 20 years when you 40? Homes, you're done
What have we become? Rap stars from trap stars
Black gods to Ansars to Sunnis back to goonies
A 360 in the streets real grizzly
Shooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning
Student enrollment to focus, yet hooligans roll with
Toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders
This ain't The Truman Show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
It's U.S.A. against the gangsta, where's the love?

Love, I'll trade you love
I've traded fire with you long enough
Is that all you brung, without love?
That's fucked up, but I saved your soul
Roll that up

[Verse 2: Nas]
Sometimes I sit on the bench just to watch the game
Feet on cement, there ain't a mobster living I could name
Who made it out rich, in his absence I do not proclaim
To not have a heart like wild animals not tamed
Maybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank
'Cept I had a vision above niggas, what I think
It's crazy how many brothers come where I come from
Some made it out big, some dead, some unsung
Shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up
Younger generation, they want to mimic and mock us
Laughing, separating themselves like they not us, like
""Cops'll look at you like they look at me? That's preposterous""
Ain't it gangsta how your man made it? I'm humble
One gun, one crazy ass nigga, that's Jungle
Now we having babies, 'cause growing up it was just us
No uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was fucked up
But still it was beautiful, the love is mutual
Even though me and Jung ain't show up to your funeral
I hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you
Your pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to
The G is in your genes, already you tuck
Inherit your dad's swag, his George Jefferson's strut
Stay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet
Don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit
Tell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise
No matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor
I'm a street corner nigga, New York Knicks loyalist
Corona sipper, pass it, I'ma blow it with you
It ain't The Truman show; it's the human show
As the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
Young brother go and get your paper, I got love
[Chorus: Cocaine 80s]
Love, I'll trade you love
I've traded fire with you long enough
Is that all you brung, without love?
That's fucked up, but I saved your soul

It's like a cold story.. repeated over and over
In the winters of my mind, yeah
This shit be real, man..
Shit's crazy out here..
Yo yo, yo what up y'all?
That's my niggas over there, word

[Verse 1]
If you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
Is he gon' cock it and pop it? His waistband big
But he don't have that thing in him, slangin just ain't in him
Body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'
'Cause he feel a way: my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway
One look could tell me if you really came to kill me
Be the quiet nigga lookin' lame with the milli
Who that over there creepin'? Who homie by the tree?
Better safe than sorry, look at p-noid me
Few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three
Be a cold day in hell 'fore they creep on me
It’s a lesson every premonition
Lot of niggas killed 'cause they wasn't payin' attention, listen
[Chorus]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

[Verse 2]
It's been so long, can’t remember how we begun this war
This is a ever-lasting thunderstorm, 'cause guns went off
I see your moms, she still speak
She don't know I ain't cool with her son no more
It’s old shit, see forever we holdin' this grudge
Takes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs
We buried our dead, been years, why should I worry 'bout him?
Constantly watchin' my back, plus niggas tellin' I dread
Another day I put a family in black
Though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt?
It’s quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted
Mothers cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide
Just tattoos of my niggas' names
I wonder, will it change? Let's ride…
[Chorus]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that’s fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

[Verse 3]
It's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position
A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down, little man, let me school you in hood business
Seen a lot of niggas blow, lot of dreams folded
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain't too much left to buy, bought it, I'm loaded, I guess
Lear jets, I ask myself: do I need love or success?
They say the artist that truly suffers, his stuff is the best
'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve: pain, pistols and sex
Remember spray paintin' the word ""fresh"" and then starin' at it
Older folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the McLaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it
[Chorus]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough

Shoot the ballot box, no voter card, they all are frauds

The Earth is cursed but I survive many climates
Calm and thoroughly, they try to Hyman Roth me
John Fitzgerald me, the industry never bought me

Feel me God? Be solid, your foes hold you in ill regard
This ain't knowledge, this is not intense
For honored men, women too

All of a sudden, frontin' niggas knew you from your past
Got all kinds of guys sayin' we go way back

""Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!""
Oh they'd arrest me, you know, especially at night
They had a curfew, niggas had to be home at 11, negros, 12
And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs
And they'd always catch you out in front of a store or something
'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right

Black sweats, swallow a lot of reefer

When I fast, I see Elijah's features

Nah it's cheaper, do it for free if you do it for me

Stumble through customs, coppin' Cubans at the Duty Free
Layin' on the most expensive beds, still I'm losin' sleep
Next to Jet's Beauty of the Week 1993
Chin-grabber, neck-choker, in-her-mouth-spitter
Blouse-ripper, ass-gripper, that dig-you-out nigga
I ain't gon' hold you, old head gave me old news
I don't owe you, shoulda heard when I told you
You are an extension of what I've worked hard to build
You believe in your own lies, can't be real
And the odds is that what you love can kill you
Like a heart physician who dies from a heart attack
I know the consumer behavior, I target that
You impressed with what they wearin', I started that
[Verse 2]
It's kinda terrific, the product of Slick Rick
Somebody woulda told me then I would come outta this shit rich
And start up a business, I woulda thought they was playin'
All them niggas I ran with, all that weight they was weighin'
A light bulb switched in my mind at the classes I cut
Just a spazz, puttin' wax in the blunt
The baddest I want, she wear Lipmatic to front
We building businesses, you can be mad if you want
It's bubbly 'til it's bubbles we see
Drinkin' like Dean Martin is nothin' to me
The spirits is somethin' I can't part and it's fun to be me

You fail to embarrass him, harassin' him
To my life, your life pales in comparison

Excursions of a searchin' child
Should learn to take nothin' personal
A parent hates to watch his baby's face
Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great
The child's introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words, nothin' is explained
Or rushed to the brain, lookin' up at his parents' face
Like, ""I thought you would protect me from this scary place?""
""Why'd you let them inject me?""
""Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?""
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?
If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso

Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways, black cars and black ice

Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny

Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky

To stay focused, it's a real sick society

To lay claim the Pan-African made it happen

Oh my Lord, discipline for the win, I just go for it

Journey far, learn who you can be
But you can learn who you are when you around family
Chip off the shoulders of soldiers, on they grizzle

They passed down wisdom, blessings were given
Pray my sins don't get passed to my children

Amazing Grace, I'm gracefully aging
Without masonry, I made more paper to play with
No rap in my playlist, sold dimes on my day shift (King)
So, can I breathe? Can I walk? Can I speak? Can I talk?
Can I floss without you wanting me outlined in chalk?
Family gossiping, pocket watching him
Jealousy keeps blossoming, ain't let it box me in (King)
'Cause you are not a king if you can't come out a thing
That you got yourself in, claiming nobody helping
The stupidest part of Africa produced Blacks that started algebra
Proof, facts, imagine if you knew that as a child, bruh
Nostalgia, how I remembеr things
Remember crowns, remember, kings
They want your reign to cease (King)
You a king, you will be next to me, doing your own king shit, most definitely
We're so ""Say less when I speak"", y'all estrogen speak
Respected by kings only, address me as chief
Invested in things only a vet would
Only lames front on kings, that's expected from creeps
You mad at my niggas and any woman with interest in me
You could've made it (You was good), look at all the time wasted
Now you gotta retract statements, shoulda stuck to the basics
All you had to do was tell the truth, like, fuck all the fake shit
You should want every brother to make it out
But brothers want trophies, they troll for clout
Rap is weird, weird flex, but okay
You ain't as ill as you think, you just okay
You got pressed in the hood, fix your jibs up, I'm on top
Stop fighting it, yo, stop with the over-righteousness
It's so lame, this media circus greedy and worthless
My life got 'em tight, why they wanna see me hurt up? (Why me?)
Real kings everywhere, stand up
It come with the game (King’s Disease)5Embed"
2.0,Blue Benz,King’s Disease,2020,"Blue Benz Lyrics[Intro]
As we go through life, one of the big questions about
Things we purchase is— is, what the value of it is
Is it really worth it?

[Verse 1]
I used to be at The Tunnel twenty deep in a huddle
Razors on us that'll make skin bubble, Moet, we guzzle
Chris Lighty let me in a few times with nines
That's on God, wish you woulda walked by
And bumped me hard or just looked at me wrong
My chain on, try to book me, you gone
Goons, Italian leathers, couple bottles of Dom
Took risks, this ain't what you want, there's rules to this
Don't get it misconstrued, my suit gamе is crisp
Silk, linen, chiffon, Dior to Diadora
But I rock custom more, that hustler aura, tap in
Razor cutter, nineties, eighties lover, raised in gutters
Raised above it, they made it up out the hood subject, I made you love it
Crazy, I knew this chick, she had a blue Benz
A Jersey penthouse, she used to pimp girls that would turn rich men out
Her coke habits was so savage
She hear voices and see ghosts on the average
Of her stepdad, he raised her from a carriage
She was twelve when he passed, she's been in hell since that
Her grandma raised her, I met her in Kingston, Jamaica
Where veteran kingpins bought acres, rest in peace Louie Rankin
Original Don Dada

Come here, come rude bwoy

Come, come on!

Peace signs in the air for son
Put his name on the street sign there where he from
Whenever we hear his bangers, flare up a blunt
And praise God, and pray we all prepared when He come for us
Just opened my new office, West Coast branch
Place my teacup on the saucer, it's Esco, man
Bossed up, nothing feels better than doing deals with my brothers
It's surreal, how I feel, y'all should love us
Life is a test so congratulations to your success
For having patience, you deserve the best
You know how they do niggas, the IRS
People I ain't even met take it out my check
They the biggest gangster, I respect the jooks
We buyin' big boy mansions, they respect the crooks

Cab service, car eighty-five
Ten minutes, they back in the car
Not safe to drive, narcos are lookin' (Woop, woop, woop)
No secret compartments in the ride, so keep pushin'
We get stopped, hide it between the seat cushion
Either that, or just tuck it inside your boot
Don't throw it out the window yet, son, that's all our loot (Not yet)
See? They turned, they wasn't after us, my nigga with me laughin' (Yeah)
He clutchin' his gold Lazarus, made it home and he baggin' up (What up?)
I'm just a lil' nigga smokin' weed (Fried)
I'm just tryna figure out who to be (Nas)
Horse and Dula touchin' paper (Uh-huh)
Plus, Spud and Wallet Head, a lot of bread
And I was talkin' to Tia
I went to her block, I was just happy to see her
And low was how she did me (Ooh)
She moved from Queens to Co-Op City (Ooh-wee)
She said, ""Visit me, that's if you really miss me"" (I did), show proof
Ten niggas outside her buildin', that's what I go through (Damn)
1989, my baby mind was advancin' (Yeah)
Nike Air Trainer 3's, two fingers on her hand, son (Ooh)
I'm losin' her slowly (Uh)
Plus my other girl is startin' to move on the homie
Hop in eighty-five, roll with me (Oh-oh)

When I used to slide
I used to call car eighty-five
Don't want no other driver on the job (Nah)
Only car eighty-five
Yo, take me uptown to that smoke shop I like (Ooh)

Everywhere we went, we took car eighty-five (Yeah, yeah)

It woulda been a good night to pick up shorty, but she on some other shit (Ooh-wee, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah)

In my peripheral view
Nothin' trivial 'bout me, just witness the truth, I'm certified
That's been verified
My mere presence got other guys terrified (Woah, ooh)
Slap oxygen out your esophagus (Ooh-ooh)
I survived with stick up kids, was droppin' shit (Ooh-ooh)
The rotten apple's the tabernacle
That's NY, White Castles at midnight
Fish sandwiches, forty ounces and fistfights (Oh, ooh-wee)
They even used car eighty-five to pull robberies
Use 'em as a getaway car and paid him properly
Next year the whole town strung out
Swept the block where they hung out
Look how far we've come now (Amen)
Grab the duffel and run out
Seven fiends in one house, hustle sun up to sundown
What up? Summertime in NY
In the back seat of car eighty-five (Oh-oh, oh)

The whole hood was tryna call car eighty-five
Any car like that, any number that had that system

You just depressed a bit, and only good for sexin' with you
Let's dismantle that, it's a man you lack
You don't need us, you could handle that
Let's see where the Black family at
We need each other, with bad tempers, we defeat each other
Single mothers, my heart's bleeding for you
These coward men, that were beating on you (Never me)
Let's silence them with a silencer
For the violence of relationships
Hold your head up, don't take that shit, run away from it
I shoulda ran away myself, the amount of pain I was dealt
And I'm a man, my job is to help
Single parent home, came up, now the man is grown
Mom's gone, pop's here, wish God reversed the roles

Sometimes witnessin' the most foulest things would arouse us

Got three hundred million people they investigating?
I know they're tryna watch me, a Russian oligarchy
Politically, it's principle they try to stop me
Powerful people will silence you, they try to mute you
Unethical ways put you in prison, try to roof you
Our youth is dead to us, they called us superpredators
Stupid words from the President's mouth, where are his editors?
Antarctica is 65 degrees
Global warming, they don't wanna believe
And they're hanging people on trees
And what the fuck is up with Gayle King?
A black male, a female thing, a failed thing
Journalism or internalism
Shirley Chisolm wouldn't play the victim
Eartha Kitt woulda been finished with him

When they tried to end on no discourse, no discussion

So what you gon' do now, Goldie? Your bottom left you
It's up to me and you, Goldie, through introspection
You ain't Goldie, you Nas, and my heart ain't cold as it was
And I go through multiple love triangles over and over enough
I talk to my boxing trainer, he's my logic explainer
Conversations through our combination
He told me, ""Stick and move,"" and ""Different rules apply to different women""
Some women's into licking women
Some women's independent, some women want brothers who educated
Some women want Benzes, leather seats that are perforated
Some do malevolent snake shit
Yo, you can miss me with that fake shit (Peace king)
[Verse 2: AZ]
Dialogue superb, flyest cars on the curb, word
When I evolved, a higher God emerged reserved
More subtle, come from the stress and the struggle
Young then, obsessed in the bubble about it
Took advantage if a woman allowed it
One of the foulest, some would say I was childish, money-driven
Mischievous, I perceived it as livin', gifts and ribbons
Any kisses on the lips was forbidden, I was on it
She curvy, then shorty was cornered, no worries
For the naughty, it was higher performance, or was it really?
The games that I was playin' was silly
Similar to them days when I was packin' that milly, it could've killed me
Caution never crossin' my mind, she callin' cryin'
Me, I'm more concerned why she ain't fallin' in line, was buggin'
Grew a lot since they said I was stubborn
Guess it's real, even players need lovin'
When you enamored by female companions, there's no standards
Once you hit and it switch the dynamics, that's the damage
Reflectin' on first impressions, what's she expectin'?
Why when men don't follow directions, it's deception?

[Verse 3: Cormega & Foxy Brown]
I was intrigued by fine women, I realized
Some were drop-dead gorgeous living a lie
Oblivious to beauty inside truly defines
Will you walk with me or are you there for the ride?
For better or worse, every blessing and curse
Understand exotic sands come after the dirt
I was dealing since adolescent
Thinking my girl was my possession, I stand corrected
It takes understanding and affection
Time is money, I need growth for my investment
I don't like attention unless it's a woman
With majestic grace like an empress in Essence
Let's just chill, catch vibes in Negril
Celebratin', many of us never made it (Haha)
Whatever brings you down won't elevate you (Uh)
Like a real one beside you is very gracious

11.0,10 Points,King’s Disease,2020,"10 Points Lyrics[Verse 1]
America the beautiful, gangsta's paradise
For a black man to be rich, you say we sacrifice our own family members
Like we're not savvy enough to make outstanding figures
And ain't nobody in no cult
I give so much, financially give away
But there's an aspect of that that's crippling to us today
Still coping and dealing with my environment as a kid
I trust no one today because what someone in my past did

[Chorus]
King, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
King, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
King, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldom they show it
King, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing
King, 'til one of your homies decide to sing
King, I started sayin' ""Peace King"" on my song ""The Flyest""
And after that, it took off like fire, peace, King
[Verse 2]
Take it from a street dude, you don't need to be a street dude
Get a lawyer, read your contract, and eat food
Become Roberta Flack or Lionel
When you catch flack, that mean they got they eye on you
Produce great results, they start to lie on you
Is it love for a Queens dude in Supreme shoes
Or did the street code expire with these dudes?
Especially now, I don't expect you to bow, but stand
Creating jobs, named my venture from after the land
I came from, that's unheard of
A hood that's known for murder now doing mergers
The streets is a lie, don't believe these dudes, jail or death is all you get
They tell you never move, but when they get money, they split

[Chorus]
King, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
King, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
King, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldom they show it
King, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing
King, 'til one of your homies decide to sing
King, I started saying ""Peace King"" on my song ""The Flyest"" (Peace King)
And after that, it took off like fire

[Verse 3]
They hardly happy for you, keep doing what you do
You can't please everybody, and not everybody is you
Don't try to force a square peg in a round circle, that shit'll hurt you
Don't try to fit in either, you're better off with neither
Few veteran speakers get medicine when you need it
Especially when we all need knowledge instead of sneakers
Stop hangin' on to childhood trauma, it defeats us
Our challenge is holding ourselves back, I hope you felt that
[Chorus]
Queen, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
King, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
King, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldom they show it
King, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing

Too many changes, you changed from your greatness
Become a byproduct of yourself all for the paper regardless
The markets see you as a old-ass artist
The McCartneys live past the Lennons, but Lennon's the hardest
Stay on your path, stay on your craft
They just want you to switch your lanes up so they can hate on your ass
What's in a name? What's in a name? Suffering and pain
Guts, blood, and tears, aim straight, game face, king's grace
I came in this thinkin' you was gon' be this great thing
'Cause I seen the greats do it with a great queen
What these kings have in common? They had women who solid
Malcolm needed Betty, I met some queens who wasn't ready
They envy the unhappiness of the greats
They don't have a fulfilled life yet, so they searchin' for ways
To feel what Sam felt, play the hand Marvin was dealt
A Vandross, here's the cure, the antidote
A thousand milligrams, make sure you don't overdose
Turned to a businessman, used to serve 'em in the cold
Cold game, don't get exposed, stories get told
You glamorize the game, it ain't a glorious road
Rest in peace Kobe and Nip, that's off the rip
King shit, if it ain't about fam, it don't mean shit
The cure, love of the allure
Donuts rotten, the phone tapped, tappin' in with Lord

Insinuate imitation 'cause I copied his stomach
Kings honor kings, straight from my pop to my son shit
Steak tartare bloody, mercury levels from raw fish
Sushi for lunch, waiter at the table, the cork twist
I'm studied like a book by many
They give me looks of envy, I took the Bentley
White chick like Liz Taylor might get the Bentayga
On my Rick James behavior
Life is school for the soul and I'm in life seven already
Life's simple but heavy, incomprehensible shit
Everything from sexy to deadly, I done been through that shit
Still goin' deeper like I grew a new inch on my dick
We looked at robbin' as a way of resolving our problems
My moms cooked food, but some of my niggas was starving
And whatever they was down to do, I was with 'em regardless
Turns out I was hungry and was hittin' the hardest
Decisions was sharper, my predictions was on it
No fortune teller, just going off regular signs
Niggas often tell ya they moves
Without a word, just reading they mind
Wasn't needin' no nine
Corner executive born in ghetto hell
Where metal yell especially over necklaces
Life lessons is karma
Whatever you dish out come back as blessings or to haunt ya
Could miss your kids and hit your grandkids for your dishonor
That's generational curses, they said they want the old Nas back
Play the Clue tapes for old verses
Messin' my homies' lives up, sayin' Nas'll rise 'em up
Like they wasn't live enough, many lives I've touched
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
I need a witness, drinkin' three at night on some Bridge shit
Wearin' shorts and Timbs, summer night on some Bridge shit
Party with gangsters, gettin' right on some Bridge shit (Yeah)

Had to inspire them again like I didn't already
Real ones still around, release the confetti
God’s Son across the belly ('Cross the belly, 'cross the belly)
[Verse 1: Nas]
I ain’t made it ‘til we all can say that we made it
Been down with the hustle so long, feel like we related
Take my word like you would from thе book of Revelations
Dead prеsidents, that shit come when you dedicated
I invest in education 'cause we wasn’t privy
We got busy, put scholarship programs throughout the city
Jefe, did it my way, chairman of the committee
Rat Pack niggas like Sinatra in the 60s
Come through on some wavy shit
Valentino camouflage on some Army/Navy shit
I know you can feel the pressure, keep up with my cadences
QB lingo, freestyles tapin’ on Stretch and Bobbito
Hit threw me the beat and I had to eat it, ugh
The lies y'all recorded in your session, delete it
Hurtin’ niggas, I think they out for the rest of the season
Tried to play it cool, they don’t wanna see me heated, nah

The world on my shoulders, it’s gettin’ too heavy
I been bench pressing the problems, ain’t even get sweaty
Cops brutalizing kids, I see it too steadily
Correctional facilities never do it correctly
My main statement is this whole game is triangulated
Little versions of who? Nigga, there’s no replacement
Besides my kids, boundaries are my greatest creation
I been on fire four generations
It’s Nas 'til I’m gone, give my all, give 'em more
Miles on my Peloton, I been working on my core
Colors of Benetton, pastel rugs on the floor
Meal prep me, Ferrari Testi
She out on the terrace, glass of Petrus with her bestie
Drunk textin' while I’m out here tryna spread the message
You searchin' for qualities that I’m already blessed with
R&B exes, charms on her necklace

Picket signs, Outlawz outside the music hall
Bunch of ghetto superstars really down to lose it all

But when you in my city, you know how we comin'
Animals in the field and most of 'em clutchin'
When you livin' this rugged, that come with repercussions, look

Like it was only so much time left
Before Makaveli the Don left
Booked a flight, flying out West
We was tryna squash the whole shit in Vegas
No media to eat it up and leak it in the papers
Eric B, Big D, and 'Preme was affiliated
Peace to E.D.I., Napoleon and all the innovators
We had respect before we was ever some entertainers
See Suge, he was a dangerous threat
M.O.B almost turned half of New York red
Brothers I grew up with threw up they sets
Some even had them Death Row chains hang off their necks
There's a rumor that spread I'd like to address
Pac was never set up by Stretch (Let it rest)
I stepped to him at Bryant Park so we could speak direct
He didn’t disrespect, we planned to reconnect

I flew to Vegas to shoot the ""Street Dreams"" video and link with 2Pac. Tried to squash the East Coast/West Coast beef. We didn’t talk, but he was still alive in the hospital. And it rained that day in Vegas. Rest In Power

My thumb struck a lot of lighters, pulled a lot of all-nighters
Banned from some afterhours spots
My crew would choose violence, move in silence
Who knew I'd grew to build an empire?
Streets had me against the ropes, would've thought I was ziplining
TECs in the dresser, money off tech, pushing a Tesla
Rolled up a fresh one, it's one IPO to the next one
Rich from corporate or thuggin', expensive mistakes
It's all a racket, it's the same thing, just the risk that you take
Moving too fast, blues on your ass
The boys came through with the task
Peep through the blinds, you knew it was curtains
Breadwinner take a L, leave the whole family hurting
Seen it a million times, system washed him out with the verdict
[Chorus]
So I'm clean as a whistle, drinking premium liquor
In-between two Argentinian sisters
They counting up for me until they fingers get blisters

Yo, as I'm looking at the New York skyline
Reminiscing on night-time, shootouts with my guys
Pouring this white wine, you could Richard Mille your left wrist
Keep in perspective, we on God's time (The world is yours)
What happens when dealers reduce to addicts?
What happens when kings don't see their potential status?
What's your exit plan? Face to face with my omens, I never ran
Stood on stages most never can, pyrotechnics and leather pants
Shifting the culture
Mention me with Mick Jagger and Bono like you're 'posed to
I'm standing next to rookies, somehow they looking older
The altitude of matter so cold, it'll make your nose run
How you expect to get love if you don't show none?
I should send you little niggas on a store run
How we're moving is no cut
I'm from the era of razor blades and coke dust
People living with no trust, champagne in the soap suds

They counting up for me until they fingers get blisters

Think you gon' send me to the store? I own the store, man

I got the hood playing golf, wild boss style
Crucifixes over the Chrome Hearts, you get crossed out
People battered down, Asian hate getting passed around
Tiger happy, both his parents' lives matter now

I never met Muhammed Ali, wish I did
My brother saw him, champ told him nothin' is real
Gave me the chills, thought about it, that's how I feel
We on autopilot, no captain behind the wheel
My whole career, I steered away from features
But I figured it's perfect timin' to embrace new leaders
Accepted my position as the master teacher
I make cash deposits before the first
Flashy diamonds, that's waterworks
Sassy models thе curviest
Brothers you knew from thе sandbox'll do you the dirtiest
Government assistance, poverty is big business
Overrun the Senate, both parties got policies built for the wicked
Look in the jungle, you gotta move like an animal
Prey on the predators, go where anybody that challenge you
Board rooms, courtrooms, it'll leave you with war wounds
I ain't wanna be this cold hearted but I was forced to
Wore my sneakers like Run-DMC did
Important to black culture like Spike Lee is
He Got Game, I wish my mom could see this
See the man that he is, moments you can't relive

Like takin' your first swim
Like still bein' a virgin
Takin' trainin' wheels off the rims
Movin' in ya first crib or having your first kid

Woulda told her Coldest Winter Ever was beautifully written

Ya actin' like the real ain't what's needed, of course I get it
What's more authentic?

Wish that my mishaps wasn't a nuisance

Third verse and I knew what to write
They say I'm a legacy artist, I blew up the price
Thirty years later, who woulda knew dude would be nice?
I hit the tables and I threw up the dice
Under the lights, outside dining, al fresco
Silk is the dress code, had to be Esco
Colors of lightbulbs change through voice command
Flew over Antigua, made the choice to land
Set my feet on a private island, house come with a staff
Chef know how to cook with no salt and low fat
Extended stay shorty, she don't wanna go back
You gotta appreciate the moments, bad times don't last
Like my first fistfight in the 'Bridge

If Chappelle moved to Ghana to find his peace then I'm rollin'
Where the service always roamin', I'm packin' my bags and goin'
It's a challenge in that, it's a balancin' act
Visit beautiful places there's more out here than the trap
Houses in Long Island, they always found 'em
House in the South, a nigga barely got out
Sunny L.A., remеmber calls with Dr. Dre
He told mе, ""Don't let the palm trees fool you, nigga, be safe""
Me and my higher self, we often would speak
Somehow we lost the connection, might meet at Joshua Tree
And it's been bothering me, too many wavy women
Gotta log outta IG, can't be my age DM'in' (Haha)
No kiddin', it's hard to move like a civilian
I write the truth 'cause I live it, not like you musical niggas
We did it big and they bigots, they'd rather shoot than write tickets
What it feel like to go get it? What it feel like to go miss it?

In one city, one country, one state
Some place to be nobody
Some place to be
Some place you wouldn't know probably
Some place to be nobody

[Verse 2: Nas]
My dawg bought a plane, said ""Let's go to Paris""
That's where baguettes are from, French bread that's long and narrow
I like the other definition, rectangular carats
The concept of this song is rather esoteric
This girl said in Grenada we should go get married
Broke the meanin' down of the Virgin Mary
And you got your own place, my favorite part of the night
When you text me that you made it home safe (I'm home)
I'm contemplatin' at the homebase
How I'm used to breakfast in the ghetto sippin' OJ
That's a picture right there, a moment in time
Before anybody wanted a photo of mine
Before the internet energy and social decline
Destroyed the vibe, foolin' us with the headlines
(Keepin' us blind) Vultures eat you alive
(Take heed to the signs) Wishin' I'd find

One city, one country, one state
Some place to be nobody

Some place you wouldn't know probably
Some place to be nobody (Life)
[Verse 3:  Lauryn Hill]
All my time has been focused on more freedom now
Why would I join 'em when I know that I can beat 'em now?
They put their words on me, and they can eat 'em now
That's probably why they keep on tellin' me I'm needed now
They tried to box me out while takin' what they want from me
I spent too many years livin' too uncomfortably
Making room for people who didn't like the labor
But wanted the spoils, greedy, selfish behavior
Now let me give it to you balanced and with clarity
I don't need to turn myself into a parody
I don't, I don't do the shit you do for popularity
They clearly didn't understand when I said ""I Get Out"" apparently
My awareness like Keanu in The Matrix
I'm savin' souls and y'all complainin' 'bout my lateness
Now it's illegal for someone to walk in greatness
They want the same shh, but they don't take risks
Now the world will get to see its own reflection
And the anointed can pursue their own direction
And if you're wrong and you're too proud to hear correction
Walk into the hole you dug yourself, fuck a projection
See me in my freedom takin' all my land back
They said a lot against me thinkin' I'd just stand back
I got my legs beneath me, I got my hands back
A lot of people sabotaged, they couldn't stand that
I turned the other cheek, I took blow after blow
There's so much crisis in the world 'cause you reap what you sow
When you keep what you know is meant for someone else
The ditch you dig for them, you might just end up in yourself
I'm in the secret place, I keep a sacred space
They keep showin' their hands, but keep hidin' their face
If I'm a messenger, you block me then you block the message
So aggressive, the world you made is what you're left with
Pride and ego over love and truth is fuckin' reckless
Y'all niggas got a death wish, the stupid leaves me breathless
[Outro: Nas]
Some place to be, yeah
Ain't duckin' nothin'
Just might have to build my own city
Where y'all need a real nigga passport to enter

Too many moments when I thought I’d never love again

Damn, I guess you haven't noticed how I always been devoted
Even when you disrobin', late nights still get the coldest

But you bein' bad is just a bonus, look how beautiful your soul is
This shit feels like a high school crush (Think we in love)
I used to be her high school crush
She woke up in a fuss and asked me, ""Why did I hide her toothbrush""
If I was honest, it'd be too much
Quiet storm on the radio puttin' me in the zone

She said ""This boy, he’s in the Navy, settle down before y'all need savin'""
Pop went to war around the world, came home, we celebrated
AWOL
Fast forward to when I started to play ball
From a place where we hate law
See the Jakes and we take off (Whoop whoop)
Hit the gate, I get home and take my chain off
Thankful I got through the day and all the evil I prayed off
Everything is cause and effect
Make the wrong moves in this business, you lose all your respect
My block is dark as it gets
We all make mistakes, only a few will recover from ‘em
Don’t spend your whole life runnin’ from ‘em, run up the numbers
[Chorus: Nas]
Should've told ‘em I’m raising up on the totem
Yeah, boilin’ over, pot full of yola
Mix it up with the cola, son of a queen and a soldier
Can’t let ‘em fuck me over, gotta keep my composure, look

[Outro: Shaka Senghor]
Keep your composure, on city blocks, and cell blocks
Keep your composure
Hold it down, hold it tight
Hold it close, hold space for yourself
It’s the way of the ancestors
Our elders, our artists, our OGs, our dreamers, our builders
With each breath internalize their successes
Their struggles, their sense of self, their sense of overcoming
And take that power forward through your life
Remind yourself of the magnitude of your good fortune
And the mere chance, one in billions, that you survived
That you will thrive
And even the strongest kings and queens bend, yet remain unbroken
Keep your composure
And believe in the magic of who we are
Because what you believe is everything
And what someone believes about you is nothing
Keep your composure, I am Shaka Senghor4Embed"
14.0,My Bible,King’s Disease II,2021,"My Bible Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy Hit, we gon' do some shit like this my nigga
Yea though I walk through the valley of infidels, suckers
Who adhere to sucker religions
Life’s a bible
We livin' in biblical times

[Verse 1]
Uh, first chapter
This chapter called ""Men""
Given knowledge by the psychotic, the block was college
We don't add it up then that shit’ll leave us divided
It's sorta like Ten Commandments
I'm talkin' 'bout men and standards, I'm tryna reverse the damage
You boys obsessed with cameras, the debt we was handed
So many move like Judas, look at the past, it's proven
It's my duty to speak truth to power
I be feelin’ like it’s my fault
Around your enemies, then they call you before you hear about it
Talk to you like it's still love, keepin’ your vision clouded
Tryna get cool with guys 'cause you want 'em to choose sides
Campaignin' with the haters, dismissin’ truth for lies
Definition of a man, don't fold on the stand
For your soul, the exec' let you hold an advance
Don't be discouraged, just go with the plan
Gotta have faith in God's grace over the land
And I pray for the day when they lay down
And caged make their way up out that maze
Get their mind up out a daze
Too many mamas layin' flowers at they graves
Don't rap about death, it's power in what you say
[Verse 2]
Second chapter, and you get what you give
It's power in how you live, I sit and talk with the kids
And tell 'em just how it is, go straight to avoid the bids
Livin' fast can wait, stay down and work on your grades
Speak gospel for the next generation
You can have it all, just don't side with Satan
I seen that take down most of the greatest
Hotel suites, Hollywood stars hangin'
The other side of what you think is fly
Your jewelry could be cursed and so can your ride
Let that soak in your mind, Suburbans and Beamers
Shot up with Ninas, how to stop a young genius
Spiritual like a deep cut from Shirley Caesar
I wonder if it's Jesus when a baby reach up
Sharpenin' up myself 'cause I know they need us
My African skin gave me the passion to win (Ooh, ooh)
Yeah, prayin' this doesn't come to a tragic end (And I pray)

[Verse 3]
Third chapter
This chapter called ""Women"", y'all been the rib since the beginnin'
A woman's intuition, is what a man is missin'
To understand your wisdom is something I had to learn
Somehow you the most unprotected on planet Earth
Your smile lift me up and your eyes kiss my soul
Your sweetness is honeycomb, such a lovely tone
You hold the power to make a house a home
Because of you, I wanna right my wrongs (Love)
Kiss your mother 'cause we only get one (One)
A grandmother's words to her grandson
Beautiful minds develop in time (Yeah)
Checks every month 'cause you held me for nine
They might see an image of a woman who's flawed
But I see a woman in the image of God
Highest regards, I light a cigar
To men, women and children, my Bible is ours (Yeah)
[Outro]
Open it up, listen to it in anytime
That Revelations' vibe, get you through it
Ain't none of us perfect, I damn sure ain't
Prayin' this doesn't come to a tragic end
We just gon' hope for the best and do our best
And be our best, no less, yeah
Yo, I woke up this morning
Had to pray to God and thank Him 'cause I made it this far
I kept it me, I'ma stay me no matter what
No matter who change up
I'ma try to get 'em to see the right path
'Cause I think I'm on the right path7Embed"

Escobar season begins

[Verse 1]
Touch up the game like a photo edit
Camera roll like Oscar Michaeux, they gotta roll the credits
Like Rome came into Kemet and they stole the essence
Before they watered it down and taught us bogus lessons
Written in stone, write whatever in your history books
Me and ancient Egyptian skin tone had similar looks
On my trip out to Cairo, I felt home on arrival
I swam in the Red Sea, took a boat on thе Nile
It's in my blood to drive thesе cars and live this large
Escobar cigars avoiding the prison bars, Nas
I deserve the threads in my closet
Big boy deposits, Nike shares and stock tips
Catching up with those who had a head start
Used to get eviction notices that had a red mark
The lights was out, that's why we sip dark
Acting a fool at the pool in Queensbridge Park
Niggas would not survive in my hood
Pull up with all of my jewels on and Nas is good
Nas is good
My nigga, Nas is good
[Interlude]
Ha, I love my hood so much, I go out in a blazing shootout
See I can't come out there, I'd throw it all away, fuck it
Big shout out to DU, forever
His brother Herb, R.I.P

[Verse 2]
Now y'all woke, I'm laughing at niggas
Y'all used to say ""Nas talking that anti-establishment business""
Look at my settlement cases, gave they asses some stitches
Used to put bottles to faces, all we ask is forgiveness
My past story full of sins
Somehow I got a cleanse, back in 2010
Department of Justice wrote me looking for one of my friends
I ain't know where he was at, didn't even have a hint
And even if I did, a nigga'll never snitch
Cheat code, I walked into my greatness
Freak hoes throw they pussy a party, okay then
Raised by a queen, that's the only reason I made it
King's Disease the reoccurrence, that shit reinstated

[Outro]
Death to the pessimistic mindstate
Lack of hope low-spirit motherfuckers
Life to king's getting a king's ransom, living handsome, ha

Just tryna get my weight up
Tryna get all my watches in order
Get my safe up, get great

[Verse 1]
I'm twenty-one years past the 27 Club
It's like I went back into my past and then I sped it up
Robert Johnson, Winehouse and Morrison found where Heaven was
Heaven on Earth, this shit is magic with no fairy dust
Home of the gully, gangsta, the gruesomе and the scary stuff
I told my brother Jung', ""Fuck 'em, thеy gon' go through Hell with us
They don't have the history in the streets that compare with us""
Hood niggas, they wanna be us, thugs in the St. Regis
Only thing undefeated is time
The second is the internet, number three is this rhyme
Before security, my dawg had to sneak in the nine
God must be on my side
I had to eat and provide, my winning streak is divine
I told dunn, ""Leave the street shit behind
Don't let 'em hype you, a slow run beats cheatin' the grind""
Dawg, I'm tellin' it like it is, you gotta deal with the consequence
When you run in a nigga's crib, nigga, you better be ready to sit

Dope dealers, street hustlers, pop cases
Throw dice, on pavement, cop chases
Big gamblers, skullies, hide faces
Gang wars, hot spots, police raid it
Left 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)
Left 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)

[Verse 2]
Pick a down on his luck rapper, bet he broke
With the arrogance of a crackhead mad at a weed smoker
Or a pill taker who hate a distilled wine drinker
A killer who use a gun to hate on a knife swinger
Aight, I get it, it's who the littest, we in competition
Y'all did it first'll be the death, I got a proposition
You and your brothers stop plottin' on each other, plot on millions
Educate yourself, find ten different areas of interest
Spread your bets out
Double down on what's working then you double up
Hands on your paper, they sending hate no matter what you touch
Honestly, I'm speechless
Fly to Greece, twenty pointers on the chain, I freaked it
Lawn chair in the hood, sittin' comfortably
I must be insane givin' you bars runnin' companies
I'm done with the redundancies, checking on my history
Making content for Viacom, license music to Tiffany's
I come from

Throw dice, on pavement, cop chases
Big gamblers, scullies, hide faces
Gang wars, hot spots, police raid it

Threw your life away in minutes

Why would I ever have to cop a chain again
When the QB chain birthed most the chains in the game?
No post office was stampin' time
Took out a slice out of the Big Apple, made apple pies, family sized
Leather bombers and Nike Sacais
Dangerous corners, you better pray that tomorrow arrives
Rap Sugar Ray Robinson, nothin' sweet
Y'all too out of shape to even box with me
Heavyweight, I know my way around the ring
Just like shawty know her way around the store
Makin' hits with Hit-Boy, all he gotta do is hit record
Record breakin' news, had to show up just to fill a void
Confused spoiler, oh, boys, y'all better keep your poise
Leave me out of the weasel shit
Be cool when you see me, I'm higher than all that rap diva shit
The hood know you pussy so we don't buy or believe in it
Locked in on the instrumental, I took back the key to this, uh
[Chorus]
Run me the keys, run me the Bs, run me that flow back
Your top three, I'm not number one, how could you post that?
I wear the crown, the city is mine, you cannot hold that

Predictions, I don't listen, it's already in my head, no funny shit
Your most hungry place, I was past that at twenty-eight
Underground tapes, that's my ASCAP and publishing stakes
As we slide in the G-ride
I been gettin' criticized, it's keepin' me energized
Create with a business mind, I'm from where killers reside
A wild hood, only knew goons since my childhood
Niggas say anything in they raps 'cause it sound good
Don't even mean what they say, horrible outlook
Y'all ain't really 'bout this, house nigs
Y'all was in the house with it
We don't respect fake jewellery and silly outfits
Window down, blowin' out kush
Gray tints, New York's J Prince on Houston Street
I caught the bounce before my nigga even bounced the beat
I took the hard way in this shit, man, it's the route for me, uh

Yes, yes
Yeah

[Verse 1]
It's ugly outside, it's muggy, it's money outside
One hundred and five Fahrenheit, thunderous skies
The clouds shape a clown face above where you reside
Under his eye, teardrop got the ugliest cry
They call my city Gotham City, opposite of pretty
Weatherman cannot predict bullets rainin' from out the 50
It's ugly outside, Big L'd be here if it wasn't
Hell'll freezе over the day it doesn't gеt ugly out
How can we hug it out after we slugged it out?
We should be buying acres, adjusting each other's crowns
That was your brother back then, how could you gun him down?
Yeah, yeah
This what I live for, the inventor
The re-invention, I'm reincarnated, see what it hit for
Yo, even your mentor can get you sent for
Get you chipped off if it's a brick off, you hit a brick wall
Damn, big dawg, dove in that water and got hit with a cannonball
Ugly Christmas sweater party with no Santa Claus
Companies profit off of black trauma
That's ugly, mad ugly just like Sheneneh and Wanda
You been through shit, I been through shit, every day is an honor
It's ugly how Mercedes Morr lost her life to a stalker
I'm on offense every day until I see the love
KD3 on the way, this just to feed the buzz

It's ugly (It's ugly, it's ugly)

It's ugly outside, they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder
I see the envy getting closer through my optics
Knew I had vision before I seen an optometrist
I seen a whole lot of shit
Never altered my confidence or my consciousness
It's ugly outside, stay dangerous, stay out the mix
Poppin' back out on niggas, homie I'm poppin' shit
Kill 'em with no accomplices
Watchin' my rearview, the envy is obvious
It's ugly outside, it's grown men jealous outside
It's grown ass women that'll have you set up to die
You really not a stepper nigga, just step to the side
While I two-step on a beat, watch a veteran slide
JMJ seen him comin', wish he ain't hit the buzzer
Marvin Gaye to Young Dolph, we taking out our brothers
Distorted faces, solemn features, we kill each other

I got that feeling, Lionel Richie, Dancing on the Ceiling
Hope it resemble a Van Gogh when you paint me the villain
The hate is real but you should know that the love is way realer
Crafty with a pen way before I could pack 'em in
Nasty with dreads, a slim teen, young, I was passionate
A brand new book cracklin' sound when you open, I'm writin' gems
I make gospel in the booth it might sound likе I'm writin' hymns
Put designer with the Timbs, wow
Thеy wanna run with my style
40-16 Building bussin' 'em down
And the fiends was like employees bringin' customers 'round
Hurricane waters, niggas had dreams of flooding the town
Weather report lookin' rainy but I skate through it daily
In a new grey Mercedes, waterproof Jordan Laneys
I'm sizzlin', scorchin', handsomely how they gotta pay me
Every recording off the head, I’m in the studio lately

Start a company from one of my phrases
We in the age of lettin' dumb shit kill your kingdom

Slurring off of the Seagram's, hell with it
Creep through the shadows, eyes wide open, Thai still smokin'
Break screechin', he's tweakin'
He see himself way different than we see him
He speak as if these mean streets was only his region
Shit, everybody’s squeezin'
Niggas know what I came in this game with, I'm not a entertainer
That's just a disclaimer for what I'm 'bout to say
Famous people sayin' they hate bein' famous, millionaires hate it
People take just to feel like they made it
Whoever claim that you changed 'cause the money came
They'd do the same if they saw they name on a hundred thangs
Pardon the haters, it's my billi behavior
If they don't say I'm the G.O.A.T, that's just silly behavior

Hope the babies eat healthier, and may we get wealthier
They was not givin', we ask for forgiveness, not permission
Whole clique is each other counsellor
Holdin' sticks without a hockey puck
Can't co-sign 'em, them niggas not with us
Hop on a private jet with twеlve tenants
Right when I land, thе chopper to Manhattan is twelve minutes
I put the ""real"" in ""real nigga"", that's on my momma though
Homie, you gotta feel me from Cali out to the Calliope
Slicker than Desi Arnez on my Copa Cabana flow
In Houston with a thick one eatin' at Pappadeaux
Shit, it was written, choppin' up competition
Palms itchin', Bohemian Grove couldn't get Nas to visit
I seen both ends of the ladder, ain't see no silver platter
Fiction don't even matter, we don't act for the cameras

Guess they used to the ego havin' head in the air

Silver spoons never fed Nasir

Flick out ashes, flip girls on a mattress
We get it crackin' without the attachments
Her and my heart is cold as Aspen, both of us laughin'
I put the ""New"" in ""New York"", I'm home
All of the watches stay on the Eastern time zone
Throwin' parties whenever I'm feeling godly
White linen parties for whenever we make a million dollars
""Nas think he too good to pull up on us""
See me at a baby shower with some OGs from Corona
Sippin' liquor, taking photos then I slid with a cougar
Coulda pulled a young love but I took who was choosing
Esco relaxed in the hood, I ain't come with a shooter
They asked what I'm doing, they said I was already proven
Who said I'm too comfortable around on my regular shit?
You know I'm a rare nigga but ghetto as shit

Won't let me pass it

I don't see the point with weak sayings like
""All them niggas on top be blocking,"" or never help, man, stop it
It’s hard watching brothers who smart but think they not
I need them to realize what they got is a fresh start
That brother that you claim so powerful
The one you said he has a whole lot of pull
Probably already tried to pull his brothers up
And got betrayed, got snaked, got played
Meanwhile he balance his challenges, hard to keep himself paid
It's so hard for him, even though his talent is God-given
Pardon him, stop putting your faults on him
What he did to you now?
The man in him is bringing the kid in you out
You kid him, he still playin' the victim, you weirdin' me out
That's what my perspective is, maybe 'cause I'm a specialist
Sippin' mixed liquor beverages
Six figure checks are big, but eight figure checks and you rich

Jump in a spacecraft, we can’t tell where we at
Chauffeur drivin' like a high-speed chase, trunk full of smack
Tallest buildin' in Manhattan, sippin' on Manhattan's
Listen to The Manhattan's, Queens to Brooklyn, oh what a feelin'

Shoulda did that remix verse on Gimme the Loot for Biggie
Me, Jay, and Frank White is like Cole, Drizzy, and Kenny
One girl for the rest of your life, is that realistic?
Some had told me they like when you call 'em all types of bitches
Ran through a few of them, some gangsta, some Christian
Some with a heart full of hate for me, even with a new nigga
They label me a sinner because I left with they soul
There's really no other feelin' havin' that type of control, nigga

'Cause we sure to rest in peace, my shorty is a piece
A piece of mind, a dimepiece, I might buy her a piece of property
You might've had some joints
But ain't nothin' like me and Rocky seen

[Chorus: Nas]
No comparison, we more solid than they are
Me and Hit-Boy, they say we like the new Gang Starr
Me and Flacko, they say we the new wave gods
Shout to Max B, he could be home any day, God
[Break: Nas, Casanova Rud, Kool G Rap & C.L. Smooth]
Come on, get on, get some
Yeah, A$AP Mob got Mass Appeal
We do our things son
Listen close as I prove my point

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Tell Hit we got a hit, ayy, ayy
Tell Hit we got a hit, ahh
Call up Nasty Nas, niggas hit the lick like ah, ah, ah37Embed"
8.0,The Truth,Magic,2021,"The Truth Lyrics[Intro]
Can't bury you with your money
Can't bury you with your bitch
Born alone, die alone
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, burn the whole place down

[Verse 1]
No more foul plays, housing mentality, shoot 'em down days
Going out of town with a couple of pound plays
Always the one you call your friend but then his style changed
Hard time for non-violent crimes, that's a outrage
We need a meeting, money and fame is fleeting
You never really know the reason why two people is beefing
Bloody murder, in the '80s, he had suede Louis seats in the 'burban
Did dirty, his sentеnce start turning
Look at life, took advice from thе streets of Vernon
Nothing nice, John Boy Ice, his death undetermined
Pick an island, anywhere for your happy solar return and
When I'm gone, I pray my family don't get the cash and burn it
To the floor, black 4's laced up
Galactica glaciers, eighty-eight karats, immaculate pay stubs
Them niggas do a crime, I drop a rhyme, it's the same rush
And they been sending shots a nigga way but they ain't struck
Can't fuck with me
I been outside since a buck fifty was the only way to get your face done
Doggystyle CD, turn that ""Murder Was the Case"" up
Thinking when I drop my first shit, I'm leaving they face scrunched
Black from the dark side of Vernon from the dime block
They had it clicking but today, it's the new slimes out
Instagram trickin' the hood, what they crying 'bout?
Petty crimes, bitches and money, that's why they lying 'bout
[Chorus]
Niggas ain't telling the truth enough (No, uh-uh, no)
Y'all don't look like the truth to us
Hype off that lil' dirt you did, that ain't shit to the kid, woah
Niggas ain't telling the truth enough (No, no, nigga)
Y'all don't look like the truth to us
Hype off that lil' dirt you did, that ain't shit to the kid, woah

[Verse 2]
Now you got your marching orders
This shit'll make your mouth water like food grill with wood chips
Woolriche, button-up flannel, looking wolfish
My hair wolfing, central bookings, simple lessons
One foot on the curb, one foot in the Lexus, my style is eclectic
Eat you pussies for breakfast, then I offer refreshments
Look all that fly shit y'all harping on
They take a watch from your arm and cops do nothing about it
That's what's going on, many changes, more races
When I was touring the nation with warrants on probation
I was a small kid amazed with the thought
One day I'd be banking, IV from drinking
Papi to Abu Dhabi, probably parley with Saudis
Crank the engine on the '74 Chevy Chevelle
Shawty friend is a snake, I told her her bestie ain't real
You gotta watch that, as the lobster crack, I spray the Baccarat
Your reputation, you can't clean that shit up at no laundromat
Sucker, see somebody has to say it, the boy still ain't graduated
I must say they cap the greatest (Be real)
My team is mature, the bags are secured
Surrounded by addicts addicted to having more
[Chorus]
Niggas ain't telling the truth enough (No, uh-uh, no)
Y'all don't look like the truth to us
Hype off that lil' dirt you did, that ain't shit to the kid, woah
Niggas ain't telling the truth enough (No, no, nigga)
Y'all don't look like the truth to us
Hype off that lil' dirt you did, that ain't shit to the kid, woah2Embed"
9.0,Dedicated,Magic,2021,"Dedicated Lyrics[Intro]
Back by popular demand, it's Magic
Ded—, ded—, dedicated (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
When Carlito was dying
He see the shadow of his girl dancing with the baby
Like, ""Fuck it, it's my time"", but if God save me
Maybe I'll erase any vice that could potentially bring harm to me
Before I make a move, I think about it karmically
Everything come back like a boomerang
I'm black as Paul Mooney slang
And all I pray for is health and a sustainable business
And a faithful missus
I see a lot of people try to be who they ain't
We don't want money that fit in the bag, we want the bank
Just to spread it around likе icing on the cake
White tigеr out the cage, Mike Tyson in '88
Dedicated like jack boys on Melrose
Smash and grab, yo, this world became a hellhole
Stay cool is what I tell those (Word) youngins
So they don't end up in jail clothes, come on
[Chorus]
I dedicated my life, my life
Dedicated my life, my life (Dedicated)
I dedicated my— (My)
Uh, uh (You know what that is? It's the inspiration)
Dedicated my— (Uh)

[Verse 2]
Whole damn life
If I wanted to now, I could live an old man life
Confronted with how the hood can use more funding
More budgets for more teachers, financial literacy, more speeches
Chefs come cook for me
Look what it took for me, the streets had its hooks in me
Yeah, people ask me what books to read
Destruction of Black civilization, that's history
Journal of Chris Columbus, that is what interests me
Juneteenth holiday finally came and it pisses me
Off for the fact that we came in chains, you'll be physically in pain
Dedicated like Ricky Walters, Dougie and Dana Dane

[Chorus]
I dedicated my life, my life
I dedicated my life, my life (Dedicated)
I dedicated my—, ah
Dedicated my (Dedicated)
I dedicated my life, my life
I dedicated my life, my life
I dedicated my—
[Beat Switch]

[Interlude]
Test, test, yeah, you know?
To get to this point
I might have to write a script, a manuscript
Yo, yo

[Verse 3]
Ghetto manners, is you thuggin' me or asking?
Finessin' me or pressin' me? Well none of that is happenin'
Accessory to murder, not necessarily Manson
I'm just a G in constructs, a Pelle Pel' or a Vanson
Ratty clothes, we haven't spoke in years, pat his coat
Check his waistline, he spyin' on who has the most
Best to leave me alone, I get in my zone
Laughin' with African presidents while over the phone
Shit be feeling like the last days, cash made
Mirrors on the ceiling with a bad babe
Same age but niggas be having mad grays
Million Man March for real niggas, never last place
Blazin' gats like young Haitian Jack
Me and money go together like the 80s and crack
Shorty aura like Kimora rockin' Baby Phat
I'm droppin bars nigga like I'm on stage with Smack
To my niggas who have staples from the navel up
Healed up, had to chill a while, lay in the cut
Shorty tried to WAP me down in the Mercedes truck
Pulled up, cobblestone ground in my palatial hut
Paradis for niggas still doing deals in the street
Original Backwoods, I fill 'em with green
Am I a musician or am I a magician?
No tricks, just real shit straight out the kitchen
[Outro]
Pure magic
No tricks, no tricks
No tricks
No tricks, pure magic (Magic, magic, magic, magic, magic)5Embed"
